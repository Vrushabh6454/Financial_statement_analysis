An engaged workforce with core 
capabilities in new and emerging skill 
areas, coupled with a collaborative, 
innovative and inclusive culture, is crucial 
for the success of our transformation 
efforts. Ensuring the safety, well-being 
and engagement of our employees is 
paramount, especially in the midst of 
a challenging external environment.
Failing to attract, retain, engage, and 
develop a diverse workforce with critical 
skills and capabilities will limit our ability 
to deliver innovative products and 
services. This constraint will hinder our 
ability to deploy the agility and speed of 
delivery necessary within the dynamic 
automotive industry.
An essential part of our strategy is to 
cultivate an agile and capable organisation 
and culture through changes in our work 
methods, significant upskilling in ACES 
(Autonomous, Connected, Electric, Shared), 
and introducing a new business purpose 
and supporting behaviours. Our culture is 
built on four pillars: Be Bold, Own It, Solve 
Together and Being Empathetic. 
Our diversity and inclusion strategy 
harnesses the unifying power of our 
differences and values the unique qualities 
of each member of our workforce.
Utilising digital capabilities and solutions 
through In Digital, as part of JLR’s 
Refocus 2.0 programme, empowers a more 
efficient, focused, and productive workforce. 
We also continue to respond to the rapidly 
evolving technological landscape where 
through our early careers, talent attraction 
and talent upskilling programmes we ensure 
our people have the skills and capabilities 
we need.

Distribution channels, retailer network and client service delivery
6
Our goal is to ensure every customer 
experiences a seamless and consistent 
hassle-free journey, delighting them at 
every interaction. Retailer partners play a 
crucial role in reflecting our brand strategy 
and vision, effectively communicating 
our values through trained and capable 
representatives. This approach aims to 
successfully appeal to new and existing 
customers, driving high customer 
satisfaction and retention levels, in both 
sales and services.
Inconsistent customer experiences affect 
existing customer satisfaction and retention 
while also hindering the attraction of new 
customers. Failing to provide exceptional 
sales and service experiences online 
and offline can weaken our competitive 
position, potentially impacting business 
and financial performance. This situation 
may necessitate investments in evolving 
distribution models like D2C to meet 
evolving consumer preferences and market 
trends continuously.
We have taken significant steps to improve 
dealer profitability and financial health. 
Simplifications have been made to online 
channels to enhance the customer 
experience. Retailer systems and tools 
have been enhanced to support sales, 
service, and technician representatives, 
ensuring a seamless customer experience. 
Other initiatives such as SOTA (Software 
Over the Air) and FOTA (Features Over 
The Air) services, Fleet Edge, Sampoorna 
Seva 2.0, and Uptime guarantee have been 
implemented to improve sales and after-
sales experiences. 
Additionally, exclusive Tata.ev stores  
have been inaugurated in Gurugram, 
providing an immersive experience to 
the EV community.

Brand positioning, innovation and rapid technology change
7
Staying competitive in the dynamic 
automotive market is increasingly 
challenging due to intensified competition 
from existing OEMs and new disruptive 
entrants, especially in the EV segment. 
Our ability to succeed in the future relies 
on staying abreast of evolving automotive 
trends, meeting changing customer 
demands through timely innovation and 
maintaining product competitiveness 
and quality.
Failure to effectively position, maintain and 
communicate the strength of our brands, 
develop new products meeting customer 
preferences, or invest adequately in brand 
building, may impact product demand. 
Delays in launching technologically 
advanced products or the obsolescence of 
existing technology could lead customers 
to choose competitors or face sales 
restrictions in specific markets.
Our proactive approach to viewing 
every regulatory change as an 
opportunity to enhance customer value 
and competitiveness has led to the 
success of our BSVI range, establishing 
its superiority. We are leading the 
development of LNG, battery electric and 
hydrogen-powered vehicles, leveraging 
our brand strength in the CV business.
In the PV business, we are increasing 
volumes through new product launches, 
multiple powertrain options and 
innovative features. Our twin-cylinder 
CNG products have gained significant 
traction. Recently, TPEM entered into 
an agreement with JLR for developing 
the ‘Avinya’ series of premium pure 
electric vehicles on the EMA platform. 
We unveiled the new brand identity  
‘Tata.ev’, embodying sustainability, 
community and technology values.
JLR has unveiled a new corporate identity 
as part of transitioning to a House of 
Brands organisation, highlighting the 
unique DNA of each brand – Range Rover, 
Defender, Discovery and Jaguar. Jaguar 
is relaunching as an all-electric brand 
from 2025, targeting a more premium 
segment, aligning with our vision to be 
‘Proud Creators of Modern Luxury’.
JLR is prioritising the development of 
software defined vehicles; autonomous, 
connected, electrified and shared 
technologies, which is inherently 
sustainable. JLR delivers modernist 
design philosophy and authentically build 
desirability and emotional engagement 
for its brands. It means we create 
inspirational, exclusive and exceptional 
experiences for our clients.

Environmental regulations and compliance
8
The regulatory landscape is rapidly 
evolving, encompassing laws, regulations 
and policies that affect our facilities 
and vehicles. The shift from traditional 
fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, 
accelerating in pace, presents compliance 
challenges. Notably, tailpipe emissions 
for automotive companies and broader 
compliance requirements for carbon 
emissions during manufacturing and other 
operations are key considerations.
To avoid significant civil and regulatory 
penalties, we may need to bear additional 
compliance costs. Competitors gaining 
advantages by adopting emissions-
reducing and fuel-efficient technologies 
before us is a risk. Failure to maintain 
environmental compliance could lead 
to significant reputational damage, 
impacting our brands and sales materially. 
Additionally, regulatory and governmental 
policy changes may introduce additional 
operational costs such as carbon pricing 
and taxation.
We are proactive in meeting 
environmental regulations and 
compliance, seeing each regulatory 
change as an opportunity to  
enhance product value and meet 
stakeholder aspirations. 
We see opportunity to continuously 
develop and expand into low-carbon 
business models and services to support 
our future clients.

Climate change
9
Climate change presents both acute and 
chronic physical risks to our operations 
and value chain. It poses transition risks 
to our business, including technological 
advancements in products and changes in 
the market and policy landscape.
The rising frequency of extreme weather 
events such as storms, floods, and 
heatwaves can directly and indirectly 
impact our supply chain and operations, 
potentially hindering our ability to meet 
demand. Changing customer preferences 
may drive increased demand for 
low‑carbon vehicles, while policy directions 
may necessitate adopting low-carbon 
manufacturing practices. Mandates related 
to carbon pricing could also amplify 
transition risks for our business.
Tata Motors acknowledges the short, 
medium and long-term physical and 
transition risks associated with climate 
change. We have set ambitious goals to 
achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2045 
in the CV business and by 2040 in the 
PV business. Our intermediate targets 
include achieving RE100 before the end 
of this decade and we are committed 
to establishing interim Science-Based 
Targets. Our operational and product 
roadmaps are fully aligned with our 
ambitions and intermediate targets.
JLR has pledged to achieve approved 
Science-Based Targets as part of its 
carbon reduction strategy, aiming for 
net zero carbon emissions across its 
supply chain, products and operations 
by 2039.

working across Materials, Energy, 
Lifetime and Utilisation pathways for 
a holistic transformation. 
At the Bharat Mobility Global  
Expo 2024 we showcased our  
Re.Wi.Re initiative, which symbolises 
our efforts to address the challenges 
of vehicle decommissioning and 
recycling. Through the deployment 
of Registered Vehicle Scrappage 
Facilities (RVSFs) and a comprehensive 
procedure for vehicle scrapping, we 
aim to contribute to environmental 
sustainability and responsible waste 
management practices. 
The Re.Wi.Re facilities are designed 
to dismantle end-of-life PVs and 
CVs across all brands and ensures 
de-pollution. The resulting scrap is 
recycled and repurposed to maximise 
its value for future utilisation, thereby 
minimising waste and contributing to 
overall environmental improvement.
The facility is fully digitalised for 
hassle-free, paperless operations 
and has dedicated stations for the 
safe dismantling of components 
such as tyres, batteries, fuel, oils, 
liquids and gases. The vehicles go 
through a stringent documentation 
and dismantling process, 
curated individually for PV and 
CV requirements.

targets for a sustainable, low-carbon future. We have already installed 78 MW 
of renewable electricity capacity and plan to add ~300 MW in the next three 
years to become a RE100 Company.
Leveraging global 
partnerships for  
climate action
Through our recent collaboration 
with the Leadership Group for 
Industry Transition (LeadIT), we aim 
to leverage global best practices, 
influence policymaking, and 
collaborate with other members 
to enhance climate action plans, 
expediting the transition towards

dedication to be a circular business. 
Tatva signifies the integration of 
circularity principles across our entire 
organisation, impacting our design, 
engineering, procurement, customer 
care, aftermarket support, and end-
of-life management processes. This 
will result in minimising usage of 
virgin materials, reducing our material 
carbon footprint, extending life of our 
products and parts and improving 
product utilisation.
By mapping the interconnection 
between various functions, we aim 
to streamline information flow and 
establish clear targets across metrics. 
These metrics track our progress 
towards becoming a circular business 
while establishing a standardised 
definition and measurement system

At Tata Motors, we are committed to 
upholding sustainable practices and 
our end-of-life product management 
strategies. We continuously strive to 
improve our products’ recyclability 
quotients through improved designs, 
selection of sustainable materials, 
and facilitating easy dismantling.
Our design-for-recycling approach 
seeks to minimise waste and 
environmental impact. Currently, 
over 85% of materials used 
in our vehicles are recyclable 
and recoverable.
In order to promote end-of-life 
management of our products, 
the dismantling information of 
Tata Nexon EV, Tata Nexon MCE, 
Tata Tiago, Tata Tigor, Tata Altroz, 
and Tata Harrier is published on 
IDIS (International Dismantling 
Information System) website. This 
information is useful to dismantlers 
for the safe disposal of Tata vehicles.
Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs)
In line with our commitment to sustainability, Tata Motors conducts thorough 
Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) to evaluate the environmental impacts of our 
products. These assessments cover resource use, ecological consequences such 
as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and ecotoxicity, as well as human health 
considerations including human toxicity and ionising radiation. We quantify these 
impacts using metrics such as Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, 
Eutrophication, Abiotic Depletion, Ozone Layer Depletion, and Photochemical 
Ozone Creation.
LCA methodology and approach
Our LCA approach, adhering to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards, 
comprehensively evaluates the total environmental impacts or ecological burden 
arising from the entire lifecycle of our products. This includes stages from raw 
material extraction through manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life disposal. 
Using our rigorous methodology, we have completed Cradle to Gate calculations, 
commonly referred to as supplier emissions, for several models including Nexon 
BS 6, Altroz Dark, Tiago BS 6, Tigor BS 6, and Puch BS 6. For upcoming models like 
Sierra and Avinya, we have set targets for decarbonisation and material circularity, 
driving these objectives systematically into our development process.
Circularity through re-use 
and re-manufacture
Our practices to re-use and 
re‑manufacture promotes circularity 
in the following ways: 
	| ‘Tata Assured’ offers certified 
used cars through its 150+ outlets, 
extending vehicle life and reducing 
landfill waste 
	| For businesses, ‘TATA OK’ provides 
a trusted platform with 350+ 
dealers to buy, sell, or exchange 
commercial vehicles with 
120-point inspections, warranties, 
and financing 
	| TATA OK@Home offers convenient 
doorstep evaluations for buying or 
selling used vehicles
Our initiatives
1.	 Integrating innovative technologies such as 
nanotechnology, utilising natural fiber composites, 
repurposing pre-consumer waste for textiles, 
promoting the recovery of precious materials, and 
extending the drainage period of oils
2.	 Using recycled materials such as upto 7% recycled 
steel, 40% recycled aluminium and 20% recycled 
glass in vehicle components
3.	 Conducting lifecycle impact assessments to 
identify major hot spots so that corrective actions 
can be taken to reduce the vehicle’s carbon 
footprint

Drishti 2.0 for technicians
Tata Motors’ Drishti 2.0 – a digital 
platform as a mobile application 
empowers technicians by providing 
easy access to payslips, leave cards, 
and travel expense submissions. This 
streamlines processes and frees up 
valuable work time. The platform 
fosters continuous learning through 
bite-sized video modules, enhancing 
skill development. Digital notice 
boards ensure clear communication 
across the shop floor. Drishti 2.0 
reflects Tata Motors’ commitment 
to a dynamic and empowered work 
environment through technology.
The Ford – Acquisition – Integration story
Tata Motors subsidiary, Tata Passenger Electric Mobility (TPEM), signed a Job 
Transfer MoU (Triparty MoU between TPEML, Ford India Private Ltd. and FIPL 
Union.) on July 26, 2022 and acquired Ford Sanand plant on January 10, 2023.
All employees coming from Ford have been assimilated seamlessly and the 
Sanand 2 plant will play a pivotal role in Tata Motors growth in passenger mobility 
and EV domain.
Higher education: Building trust
A unique initiative saw all workmen-level employees offered higher education 
programmes in Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing, and EV systems through a 
partnership with Ganpat University. This not only upskilled the workforce but 
also fostered trust in Tata Motors, marking a first in the industry for such a 
comprehensive sponsorship programme.
People integration and growth
TPEM extended its ‘Care & Belongingness’ philosophy through initiatives like 
Sangam, encouraging cultural assimilation and employee well-being. Notably, 
51 workmen received promotions within a year, showcasing internal talent 
development. Six Sigma training further bolstered problem-solving skills, aiming 
for 100% Green Belt certification among staff – a first for Tata Motors plants.
A win-win cultural assimilation
A blend of best practices from both companies was adopted, with an emphasis 
on Ford’s strengths. The Sanand plant now operates under an ‘inverted pyramid’ 
structure, empowering staff and fostering a ‘Serve and Care’ environment. This 
shift from a command-and-control model has resulted in a leaner staff structure.
Wage settlement
Tata Motors fosters strong relationships 
with its seven unions, representing 14,000 
technicians. Open communication and 
collaboration are key, with joint forums 
addressing challenges. Long‑term wage 
settlements are established through 
discussions, considering future needs. 
Productivity-linked settlements in Sanand 
and Lucknow showcase successful 
collaboration between management 
and unions.

Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) 
All worker activities are mapped, and hazards are accordingly identified based 
on the nature of activity, history of incidents and experience of workers. 
The hazard categories considered are: Trivial, Tolerable, Moderate, Substantial, 
and Intolerable. For all such identified hazards, risk is calculated based on 
severity and likelihood.
Tata Motors places utmost importance on quality and safety in its strategic 
roadmap, ensuring employee well-being despite external challenges. 
We invest in safety technologies and R&D to deliver the safest vehicles 
across segments. Our facilities uphold standardised systems, certified for 
ISO TS 16949 (QMS standard for the automotive industry), ISO 9001 and 
ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System), as well as for ISO 45001:2018

fostering a world-class safety culture, 
prioritising the well-being of our 
employees and stakeholders across all 
operational facets. Our commitment 
was prominently highlighted during 
the 2023 Tata Group Workshop, where 
safety discussions with the Chairman 
took central stage. Throughout FY24, 
the Zero Incident Plan continued 
to be a cornerstone, featuring 31 
themes and 51 major actions led 
by a senior leader, ensuring its 
sustained effectiveness.
A robust governance system ensures 
multi-level safety reviews, with the 
SHS Committee of the Board serving 
as the apex review body. Monthly 
evaluations by SHE Councils and Apex 
Committees at plant levels oversee 
safety performance, while focused 
safety reviews are conducted in 
non-manufacturing areas at defined 
intervals, engaging Customer Service 
and Warehouse teams.
Continuing our commitment to 
enhancing safety culture, we 
engaged external experts DSS+ 
to fortify our approach across 
four pillars: Leadership and 
Governance, Operations and Risk, 
Business Partners, and People and 
Performance. Strategically aligned 
actions for FY24 focus on proactive 
governance and fostering a Zero Harm 
Culture through leadership behaviours 
communicated across all levels.
In operations and risk, our Model 
Areas Initiative showcased exemplary 
safety role modelling, with leaders 
demonstrating adherence to safety 
standards. Our systematic approach 
to hazard identification and mitigation 
at Critical to Safety Stations led to 
a significant reduction in injuries.

Circular 
economy and 
resource efficiency
In the last 12 months we have 
developed a circular economy strategy 
based on a single key principle – the 
decoupling of value creation from 
resource use. Our world currently 
depends on the consumption of virgin 
natural resources to generate value. If 
we are to meet our net zero ambition, 
we must change that dynamic primarily 
through three mission statements: 
Circular resources: We must act as 
a responsible user of resources by 
maximising reuse, replenishment 
and recycling. Circular products and 
services: We must provide timeless 
modern luxury through enhanced 
product utility and longevity. Circular 
enablers: We must create circular 
value through systemic collaboration, 
innovation and partnerships.

We are engaging with partners 
across the value chain to learn, 
collaborate and innovate to support 
delivery of the circular resources and 
circular products and services. These 
enablers rely on a strong supplier 
base and key innovative partners 
with a common vision to create 
systems where value is distributed 
along the product lifecycle. The 
enablers include the setting up of 
a circularity hub, driving circularity 
improvements throughout the entire 
supply chain via our Circular Supply 
Chain department and meet-up 
events to inspire and mobilise our 
sustainability innovation ecosystem 
by driving circular solutions through 
systemic value chain collaboration.
To ensure we act as a responsible user of resources we have set specific 
long-term goals to drive an increase in the quantity of recycled content in our 
products, to reduce waste to landfill and to energy recovery, and reduce our 
consumption of water per vehicle produced.
Materials: At least double and aim to treble recycled content in new products 
from 2028 
Waste: Achieve zero waste to landfill and increase non-metallic waste sent for 
recycling/reuse to 80% by FY30
Water: Reduce our water consumption per vehicle produced by a third 
by FY30
We intend to increase the share of products and services which contribute 
to our circular economy goals by growing our capability to reuse parts and 
vehicles. This means growing our lease and subscription offers to establish 
a ‘serial usership’ model, which supports the creation and retention of the 
value that is inherent in our products. The transition from the traditional 
linear ‘make and sell’ business model to a more sustainable, circular mobility 
model will ensure we retain a high degree of control over the resources 
embedded in our products.
Our strategy is based around three key focus areas

Nature and biodiversity
Nature and biodiversity form an important part of our sustainability strategy. 
We are developing a new policy to set out our commitments to counteract nature 
and biodiversity loss. Alongside this, we are developing our strategic approach to 
consider our material impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities for nature 
and biodiversity across our direct operations, supply chain and wider value chain. 
Biodiversity at our facilities
The Electric Propulsion Manufacturing Centre (EPMC) at Wolverhampton, UK 
is managing existing habitats around the site and within the adjacent Clewley 
Coppice woodland to support important species such as badgers, field mice 
and water voles. In Slovakia, our Nitra facility has a renewed agreement with 
Constantine the Philosopher University to continue biodiversity monitoring. 
The monitoring has shown that as native habitats have recovered, there has 
been a natural reintroduction of many native species of birds, insects and small 
mammals. In China, sustainable development practices at the Changshu facility 
support biodiversity-related initiatives to monitor plant and animal species, as 
well as a poster initiative to educate and raise awareness around protecting 
the environment.

strengthens risk reduction and developing emergency response mechanisms, 
helping reduce disaster and humanitarian risks for the most vulnerable areas.
Disaster Relief Alliance 
We are an honorary partner of the Disaster Relief Alliance (DRA), whose 
contributions help with global disaster preparedness, as well as responding 
quickly to emergencies across the globe. Over the last year we have 
provided over £100,000 to support disasters and emergencies including the 
devastation of earthquakes in Türkiye (Turkey), Syria and Morocco.
Community resilience
We have supported Community Resilience Teams (CRT) in New South Wales, 
Australia, to train local government and community agency members in 
disaster preparedness. In Nepal, we have reached households with resources 
on how to prepare and adapt for disasters and climate change, with a 
special focus to engage young people. In Italy, we supported the creation of 
integrated urban disaster preparedness and response plans. In addition, we 
have supported the training of staff at Swiss Disaster Dog Association (REDOG) 
increasing their skills in missing buried person searches in Switzerland during 
times of crisis.
Toré Institute, Brazil
We have developed an agroforestry educational programme in partnership 
with the Toré Institute, in a public school local to our Itatiaia manufacturing 
plant, to teach children about sustainability. The educational project teaches 
reforestation and composting, and gives children the opportunity to plant 
and grow their own food. As a continuation of this programme, since launch 
last year, we have restored one hectare of land close to the factory.

Our work on responsible business focuses on four main areas of activity: 
legislation and regulation, strategy and governance, risk management, 
and disclosure and reporting.
Legislation and regulation
The legislation and regulation of 
environmental, social and governance 
topics is a rapidly evolving space. 
Ensuring that we are aware of 
relevant legislation and are putting 
the right steps in place to meet the 
requirements requires collaboration 
and input from many teams across 
the business. To ensure we stay 
ahead of emerging requirements, 
we established an ESG Legislation and 
Reporting working group that met 
12 times this year.
Strategy and governance
There are high expectations from 
our stakeholders on what we do in 
relation to sustainability. To meet 
those expectations, it is crucial that we 
have the right sustainability strategies 
and governance in place across 
the business.
Risk management
The management of our environmental 
and social risks are embedded in 
our Company-wide enterprise risk 
management (ERM) process. We work 
with multiple stakeholders from across 
the organisation to identify and put 
plans in place to address the most 
significant environmental and social 
risks to our business.
The Responsible Business pillar forms the foundation of 
our sustainability strategy from which we aspire to achieve 
positive outcomes for the planet and its people. It is about 
getting the basics right and ensuring that what we do as 
a business is done ethically and with integrity.

that we can truly thrive and create 
a culture where our people feel 
supported equitably, can be their 
authentic selves, and allow fresh 
ideas, challenges, and opinions to

Disclosure and reporting
There are increasing expectations 
for companies to disclose what 
they are doing to manage their 
impacts, risks and opportunities on 
a variety of sustainability related 
topics. Sharing our objectives and 
performance on environmental and 
social topics is crucial to meet the 
varying needs and expectations of our

workforce through upskilling programmes that build critical capabilities internally. 
Our engineers continue their development journey through attendance at 
co‑created and bespoke courses developed in partnership with a local university,

In September 2023, we hosted our first 
ever Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Summit, welcoming participants in 
person, and online in 26 countries with 
17 global inclusion hubs. This event 
was a celebration of the progress made 
to date in changing our culture, and 
also introduced the term ‘equity’ to 
our business. This has cemented our 
ambition to ensure that all colleagues 
are supported.
We continue to partner with the 
Business Disability Forum, working 
with them to inform our disability 
strategy. This will continue to be a key 
focus in FY25. We have also partnered 
with the Amos Bursary in supporting 
the sponsoring of young students of 
African Caribbean descent from Year 
12, for up to five years whilst they are 
in higher education. As part of this we 
provide mentoring to help students 
think about what career paths they 
may want to pursue and support 
their ambitions.
Early careers
Early Careers and investment in 
apprentices, undergraduates and 
graduates continues to form a 
key foundation to our talent pool

skills for the future. Through hiring 
drives, we expect to see over 900 
people join us in the UK and a 
further approximately 300 globally

Safety 
The Zero Harm Metric takes into account 
all work-related incidents where an 
injury has occurred. Overall, the metric 
has been stable over the past year, 
following several years of decline. 
Improvements have been made in the 
internal reporting and data analysis 
structure over the last 12 months, which 
has led to greater ability to analyse 
trends in the data. The majority of 
accidents reported (~90%) are cuts, 
bruises or sprains/ strains, and have 
low harm potential. Lost time incidents 
continue to decline, showing an 
improving trend over the past year.
Our Safety Management System 
continues to be refined and improved 
to provide an effective framework for 
safety organisation. Following three 
years of monitoring visits, the Safety 
Management System was recertified to 
the ISO45001 standard in March 2023, 
demonstrating our ongoing commitment 
to achieving the highest standards of 
health, safety and well-being to our

Responsible value chain
At TML, our commitment to 
sustainability extends throughout 
our supply chain. Launched in 
2017, the ‘Sustainable Supply Chain 
Initiative’ sets a robust framework 
with a Supplier Code of Conduct, 
Environmental Procurement Policy, 
and Sustainability Guidelines. These 
ensure our partners prioritise ethical 
sourcing, environmental responsibility, 
and social well-being. This year, we 
leveraged the collaborative platform 
‘AIKYAM’ (launched in 2024) to 
streamline these efforts. We assessed 
483 suppliers against our ESG criteria, 
gaining valuable insights into their 
performance. Furthermore, the 2019 
Dealer Sustainability Guidelines ensure 
our dealerships align with our goals. 
By actively evaluating and training 
suppliers and dealerships (353 assessed 
last year), we’re building a responsible 
and sustainable supply chain 
ecosystem that underpins our vision for 
sustainable mobility.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
FY24 marked a dichotomous journey for the Indian 
Commercial Vehicle (‘CV’) industry as it shifted to BS6 
Phase II emission norms. The first half started optimistically 
with a surge in sales volumes across most business segments. 
However, the second half saw a moderation in growth due 
to the combined impact of a high base, elections in five 
states and impending general elections. Driven by the 
government’s focus on infrastructure development and a rise 
in e-commerce, construction, and mining activities, there was 
a consistent demand for heavy trucks and passenger carriers 
throughout the year, leading to a 3% and 28% increase in 
their sales volumes, respectively. Despite this, the overall 
CV industry experienced a modest growth of 2% in FY24 
as demand in the ILMCV, SCV Cargo, and pick-up segments 
declined, highlighting the cyclical nature of industry.
With a continued emphasis on retail pull from the previous 
year, the CV Business aimed to further increase realizations 
by leveraging its superior BS6 Phase II product range, while 
also improving market share, especially in the HCV segment. 
With a synergised backend and a fully equipped front 
end, each business vertical is independently charting its 
growth path with clear milestones set to track financial and 
market outcomes.
CV business improved on key customer facing metrics. 
The business achieved the highest-ever Net Promoter 
Score (‘NPS’) of 72 while maintaining stable Brand Power. 
The business continues to maintain high levels on Composite 
Customer Satisfaction Index in FY24.
143 products and 700+ variants for passenger and cargo 
transportation were launched in FY24 to fulfil the growing 
demand for safer, smarter and greener mobility solutions.
CV exports remained subdued due to the prevailing economic 
situation as well as geopolitical events in most overseas 
markets. In FY24, the exports were 12% lower than in FY23, 
while revenue maintained its level of the previous year due to 
improved mix. Major drop was witnessed in the SAARC region 
(-10%) driven by Total Industry Volume (‘TIV’) softening, forex 
shortages, and"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"liquidity crunch in the latter half of the year. 
MENA region witnessed 23% year-on-year (‘y-o-y’) in exports. 
The business retained and grew its market share and also 
sequentially improved margins across most markets.
CV business won several prestigious awards in FY24 
acknowledging the excellence of products, services, 
solutions, initiatives and people, with few notable ones 
being Coveted National Energy Conservation Award from 
President of India, Golden Peacock National Quality Award, 
CII Industrial Innovation award, 7 Apollo Commercial Vehicle 
Magazine awards, Gunsan Grand Commerce & Industry 
Award and others.

in the Management Discussion & Analysis section for 
detailed analysis.
Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited  
(‘TMPVL’)
The Indian Passenger Vehicle (‘PV’) industry recorded the 
highest-ever annual wholesale volumes of 4.2 million units in 
FY24. After two strong years of growth, the industry growth 
moderated to 8.6% in FY24 over FY23. The growth has come 
on the back of strong traction for new product launches and 
emission-friendly powertrains, i.e.,  CNG vehicles and Electric 
vehicles. The segment shifts in the industry continues to gain 
momentum as the Sports Utility Vehicle (‘SUV’) segment 
grew 28% as compared to FY23 and now accounts for 
51% of the overall industry volumes. The demand for hatches 
continues to decline as the volumes have decreased by 
12% as compared to FY23.

Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited  
(‘TPEML’)
The Indian Electric Vehicle (‘EV’) industry witnessed 70% 
growth in FY24, with over 1 lakh units sales volume in the 
year as compared to 58 thousand units in FY23. The growth 
was driven by increased customer adoption of EVs, as barriers 
to adoption are increasingly being addressed. The year 
also saw launches of many new EV models by automobile 
manufacturers, as the competitive intensity in the industry 
continues to grow.
The EV business continues to consolidate its leadership 
position  in the EV industry with 73,844 units of EV sales in 
FY24. The EV business took holistic steps to enable mainstream 
adoption of EVs. Tata Motors’ EV product portfolio was 
widened with the introduction of Punch.ev, which opened up a 
new price point and bodystyle for customers. To drive a faster 
pace of growth for charging infrastructure, the EV Business 
team  also conducted the first Charging Day event, which has 
brought about open collaboration with charging ecosystem 
players. The EV business also launched a new customer 
facing brand identity for EVs and EV-exclusive showrooms, 
to provide a differentiated and curated experience for EV 
customers. As a result of these initiatives, the EV business 
registered a growth of 48% in FY24 over FY23.

INITIATIVES TOWARDS DIGITAL PRODUCT 
DEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS:
Digital Excellence through New Technology Adoptions and 
Digitalization. These are put into effect by a dedicated function 
on Digital Product Development & Business Processes. 
The Company has been a leader in Digitalization in Engineering 
Space in Indian industry and an influencer in the global auto 
industry. Enhanced digital product development systems 
are contributing to design of safe, smart connected vehicles. 
Achievements through various initiatives are listed below:
•	
All commercial EVs, medium and heavy trucks and buses 
from the Company are Fleet Edge ready with a 4G SIM 
embedded in them. The Telematics Control Unit (‘TSU’)
is AIS 140 compliant, with safety and security functions. 
Advanced algorithms analyze data inputs from these 
smart vehicles on multiple parameters to present several 
value-adding insights. Fleet owners and managers can 
accordingly take better and informed decisions as per 
their business need.
•	
Continuous adoption of new technologies in the digital 
product development domain to improve product design 
& development processes contributed to two key goals 
– Time to Market & World Class Quality. Front loading 
in design & development resulted in timely delivery and 
ensuring that new products are developed with lower 
cost impacts due to changes.
•	
Niche integration tools, systems and processes continue 
to be enhanced in the areas of CAx, Knowledge Based 
Engineering (KBE), Product Lifecycle Management 
(PLM) and Manufacturing Planning Management (MPM) 
for more efficient end-to-end delivery of the product 
development process.
•	
Data driven analytics using AIML / GenAI is playing big 
role in enhancing business operations to next level. Data 
analytics is providing insights of what, where and when 
about failure / critical events to focus on and alerts for 
planning corrective actions in advance.
•	
Simulation process and data management plays vital 
role in Digital Validation. DPDS developed single 
framework for Generation of CAE Preprocessing inputs 
decks for aggregates.
•	
Reducing physical prototypes thus reducing product 
cost and time to market is the sole objective of digital 
validation. High Performance computing (‘HPC’) on 
premise setup is deployed across various domains 
(Crash, Durability, Climate control, Heating Ventilation 
Air Conditioning, Noise Vibration Harshness) and it 
is heavily leveraged for robust design, 5 star safety 
as well as cycle time reduction through digital-
physical correlation.

1.
Carbon 
Emissions and 
Climate Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Climate Change poses 
acute and chronic physical 
risks to our operations and 
value chain. Climate change 
also poses transition risks 
to our business, which 
include technological 
advances in products and 
evolving market and policy 
landscape changes.
TML is cognizant of the 
physical and transition risks 
posed by climate change 
in the short, medium and 
long term. We have set 
ourselves ambitious targets 
of achieving Net Zero GHG 
emissions by 2045 in CV 
business and 2040 in the 
PV business. We have set 
intermediate targets of 
achieving RE100 before the 
end of this decade and are 
committed to set interim 
Science Based Targets.
Our roadmap, at the 
operations level and 
product level are fully 
aligned to our ambition and 
our intermediate targets.
An increase in the 
frequency of extreme 
weather events like storms, 
floods, heatwaves could 
have significant direct 
and indirect impact on 
our supply chain and our 
operations, thus adversely 
affecting our ability to 
fulfil demand.
Evolving customer choices 
may lead to increased 
demand for low-carbon 
vehicles. Policy direction 
may require us to adopt 
low carbon manufacturing. 
Carbon pricing mandates 
may potentially enhance 
transition risk.

2.
Environmental 
regulations 
and compliance
Risk
We are subject to a rapidly 
evolving regulatory 
landscape with associated 
laws, regulations and 
policies that impact our 
facilities and vehicles. 
The transition away from 
traditional fossil fuels to 
renewable energy sources  
and the increasing pace 
of that transition creates 
compliance challenges. 
Notable to mention here 
are tailpipe emissions for 
automotive companies 
and wider compliance 
requirements for carbon 
emissions produced 
during manufacturing and 
other operations.
TML is ahead of the curve 
in meeting environment 
regulations and 
compliance as we view 
every regulatory norm 
change as an opportunity 
to add significant value 
to our products while 
meeting our stakeholder’s 
aspirations. e.g. In the BS4 
to BS6 transition, we have 
capitalised by refreshing 
our entire portfolio with 
significant product upgrades 
that add immense value 
throughout the product 
life-cycle.
We may incur additional 
compliance costs to avoid 
facing significant civil and 
regulatory penalties and 
our competitors may gain 
an advantage by adopting 
new emissions-reducing and 
fuel-efficient technologies 
before we do. Furthermore, 
we may incur significant 
reputational damage, which 
could materially impact 
our brands and sales, if we 
fail to meet environmental 
compliances. Regulatory 
and governmental policy 
changes may introduce 
additional operational costs 
in the form of carbon pricing 
and taxation.
3.
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Consumers are increasingly 
interested in the 
sustainability of products 
they purchase, including the 
environmental and social 
impacts of the entire supply 
chain. Non-compliance 
of the supply chain with 
environmental, labour 
and ethical standards 
can lead to reputational 
damage, legal liabilities and 
operational disruptions.
We are dedicated to leading 
the way in Sustainable 
Mobility, with a focus on 
our supply chain. Initiatives 
like the ‘Sustainable 
Supply Chain Initiative’ 
(launched in 2017) and 
‘AIKYAM’ a collaborative 
platform (introduced in 
2023) underscore this 
commitment. We have 
established a robust 
framework including a 
Supplier Code of Conduct, 
Environmental Procurement 
Policy and Sustainability 
Guidelines covering 
governance, compliance, 
transparency, safety and 
human rights. Oversight 
mechanisms, led by the 
Executive Committee and 
Chief Purchasing Officer, 
ensure effective execution. 
Continuous review of 
procurement practices 
maintains alignment with 
sustainability goals.
Dependence on 
unsustainable suppliers may 
disrupt operations and harm 
product quality. Conversely, 
investing in a sustainable 
supply chain can yield long-
term cost savings, enhance 
brand value and meet 
stakeholder expectations.

4.
IT and Cyber 
Security
Risk
We are exposed to IT 
risks since IT plays an 
important role in our 
operations, including the 
manufacturing, design of 
engineering processes. 
With our vehicles becoming 
increasingly technologically 
advanced and connected 
to the internet, they may 
become more susceptible to 
unauthorised access. We are 
also subject to risks related 
to legacy IT systems and 
system migration projects.
Information risk and cyber 
security are managed 
strategically. Through a 
cohesive programme of 
initiatives, we mitigate 
significant business risks 
while positively influencing 
business and brand value, 
growth, stability and overall 
success. We continue 
to drive measurable 
improvements in cyber 
defense and other core 
security capabilities 
(e.g., security ecosystem, 
supply chain security, risk 
governance and cultural 
change).
Successful cyber-attacks 
could cause significant 
business disruption, 
affecting our ability to 
deliver products and 
services to our customers. 
In extreme situations, this 
could affect the personal 
safety of our customers and 
colleagues. Regulatory and 
statutory requirements are 
increasing and failure to 
meet these obligations, such 
as the statutes of privacy 
and data protection law, 
could result in enforcement 
action, fines, reputational 
and financial damage. 
Any IT system migration, 
if not carried out within 
defined timelines or if 
implementation and 
outcome are not as desired, 
could materially adversely 
affect our operations, affect 
financial performance and 
cause reputation damage.
5.
Circularity
Opportunity
Circular business models 
enable creation of economic 
value at every stage of 
a product’s lifecycle by 
ensuring products retain 
their original identity and
function. Circular business 
models allow higher 
utilization, incentivize more 
reliable & durable products 
while enabling reuse and 
refurbishment of products 
and components even as 
they are designed.
TML has built a circular 
economy framework 
“Tatva”, signifying our 
commitment to embedding 
circular economy 
principles across our 
entire organization. Tatva 
represents the essence 
of integrating circularity 
into every aspect of our 
business, aiming to reduce 
virgin material consumption, 
lower our material carbon 
footprint, extend life of our 
products & parts, as well 
as improving utilization of 
our products.
Designing for circularity 
is a key component of the 
Circular Economy. 
Maximum value is drawn 
when all the circular 
business models of 
Servitization, Longer 
durable life and Reuse are 
deployed in conjunction 
ensuring recurring revenues 
throughout the lifecycle.

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,Capital Resources,"Within this endeavor, we’ve established a comprehensive framework comprising a Supplier Code of Conduct, an 
Environmental Procurement Policy and Sustainability Guidelines for Suppliers. These guidelines encompass critical aspects 
such as governance, legal compliance, management system certification, transparency and reporting, occupational health

among our suppliers and partners alike."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,Capital Resources,"In tandem with these foundational guidelines, we’ve instituted robust oversight mechanisms to ensure the effective

assessments, we gauge their adherence to sustainability standards, thereby gaining valuable insights into their environmental 
and social performance. Recognizing the indispensable role of internal stakeholders, comprehensive training is imparted 
to our company’s buyers and relevant personnel. We pursued this initiative downstream in 2019, wherein the Dealer Code 
of Conduct and the Dealer Sustainability Guidelines were developed to guide dealerships to improve their sustainability 
practices, along with assessments of their ESG performance through assessment questionnaires."

our Plants ensure that the management of such wastes is done in full compliance of these legal requirements as specified 
by the operating permits, consents and authorizations. Our manufacturing operations receive a large and diverse number 
of parts, components and consumables in various forms of packaging which are discarded. These are segregated as 
per material type and shape and sold to re-cyclers for conversion and utilization. Specifically, we ensure the sale of all 
flexible and rigid plastic packaging to authorized plastic waste processors for re-cycling and utilization in manufacture 
of new packaging material. Hazardous and Other Waste are similarly routed to authorized re-cyclers or re-processors 
for material recovery or to co-processing for energy recovery through cement plants. We also ensure safe disposal of 
specific hazardous wastes as mandated in operating Consent/Authorizations, through Government authorized Treatment 
Storage and Disposal Facilities. E-wastes from our Operations, comprising of electronic devices, their components and IT 
assets that are discarded after their useful life or due to obsolescence, are disposed only to authorized re-cyclers. Where 
technically feasible, we are utilizing the recovered material such as reclaimed thinner, secondary paint made from paint

Understanding the Landscape: TML is based out of from diverse locations, ranging from modern commercial spaces to 
heritage buildings with historical significance. Each setting presents its own set of challenges and opportunities in terms 
of accessibility. While some commercial locations may already boast inclusive premises due to modern construction 
norms or proactive measures, older buildings may require significant retrofitting to meet accessibility standards."

Information in “Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report” section of the Integrated Annual Report for

Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (SEBI LODR) and basis of 
preparation set out in Section A: General Disclosures 13 
of “Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report” of

Basis for opinion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by 
the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board 
(IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are

We have complied with the independence and other 
ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for 
Professional 
Accountants

Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA).
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality 
Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that 
Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other

IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement 
and operate a system of quality management, including 
policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Other information
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible 
for the other information. We have performed a limited 
assurance engagement on select BRSR and GRI indicators and 
issued an independent assurance report on 29 May 2024.
Our report thereon is included with the other information.

ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the previous assurance 
practitioner who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 
10th June, 2023. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended 
for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core 
attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read 
the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and 
understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate 
levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Responsibilities for the Identified Sustainability 
Information (ISI) 
The management of the Company acknowledge and 
understand their responsibility for: 
•	
designing, implementing and maintaining internal 
controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error;
•	
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
ISI, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, 
if any, related to reporting on the ISI, identification of 
key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, 
preparation and presentation of the ISI in accordance 
with the reporting criteria;
•	
disclosure of the applicable criteria used for preparation 
of the ISI in the relevant report/statement; 
•	
preparing/properly calculating the ISI in accordance 
with the reporting criteria; and 
•	
ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the 
intended users with relevant explanation;
•	
establishing targets, goals and other performance 
measures and implementing actions to achieve such 
targets, goals and performance measures;
•	
responsible for providing the details of the management 
personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in 
the report;
•	
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
law, 
regulation 
or 
applicable contracts;
•	
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable in 
the circumstances; 
•

the measurement or evaluation of information subject 
to assurance in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
•	
preventing and detecting fraud;
•

and engaging with intended users to understand their 
information needs;
•	
informing us of other information that will be included 
with the ISI;
•	
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of 
the ISI.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing 
the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.
Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI
The preparation of the company’s BRSR information requires 
the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make 
determinations about the relevancy of information to be 
included and make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, 
some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water 
footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate 
evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce 
the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	
Planning and performing the engagement to obtain 
reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures 
in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the 
Reporting Criteria in line with the section above. 
•	
Forming an independent opinion, based on the 
procedures we have performed and the evidence we 
have obtained and
•	
Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the 
Directors of Tata Motors Limited. 
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we 
will not express a conclusion on the same:
•	
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned 
in the “Scope of Assurance”.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information 
(qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.

Summary of the work we performed as the 
basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgment and maintained 
professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We 
designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our reasonable assurance opinion. The nature, timing 
and extent of the procedures selected depended on our 
judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the information subject to reasonable 
assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement through 
understanding the Information subject to reasonable 
assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also 
obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to 
the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to 
design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances

Asian economies such as China, Japan, India, and South 
Korea are among the largest net oil importers globally. Hence 
continued shipping disruptions could hit Asia. A rise in oil 
prices may pose upside risks to inflation and, consequently, 
to growth.
Global growth, estimated at 3.1% in 2023, is projected to 
remain at 3.1% in 2024 before rising modestly to 3.2% in 2025. 
Compared with that in the October 2023 WEO, the forecast 
for 2024 is about 0.2% higher, reflecting upgrades for China, 
the United States, and large emerging market and developing 
economies. Nevertheless, the projection for global growth 
in 2024 and 2025 is below the historical (2000–19) annual 
average of 3.8%, reflecting restrictive monetary policies 
and withdrawal of fiscal support, as well as low underlying 
productivity growth. Advanced economies are expected to 
see growth decline slightly in 2024 before rising in 2025, with 
a recovery in the euro area from low growth in 2023 and a 
moderation of growth in the United States. Emerging market 
and developing economies are expected to experience stable 
growth through 2024 and 2025, with regional differences.

limit and be eligible to draw their pension calculated 
based on last 5 years average salary. The Company

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR 
ADEQUACY
We have an adequate system of internal controls in place. 
We have documented policies and procedures covering 
all financial and operating functions. These controls have 
been designed to provide a reasonable assurance regarding 
maintaining of proper accounting controls for ensuring 
reliability of financial reporting, monitoring of operations, 
and protecting assets from unauthorized use or losses, 
compliances with regulations. We have continued our 
efforts to align all our processes and controls with global 
best practices.
Some significant features of the internal control of systems are:
•	
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, 
comprising entirely of independent directors and 
functional since August 1988, regularly reviews the 
audit plans, significant audit findings, adequacy of 
internal controls, compliance with accounting standards 
as well as reasons for changes in accounting policies and 
practices, if any;
•	
Documentation of major business processes and testing 
thereof including financial closing, computer controls 
and entity level controls, as part of compliance program, 
as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
•	
Robust Enterprise Resource Planning, supplier relations 
management and customer relations management 
connect our different locations, dealers and vendors for 
efficient and seamless information exchange. We also 
maintain a comprehensive information security policy 
and undertakes continuous upgrades to our IT systems.
•	
Detailed business plans for each segment, investment 
strategies, year-on-year reviews, annual financial 
and operating plans and monthly monitoring are 
part of the established practices for all operating and 
service functions.
•	
A well-established, independent, multi-disciplinary 
Internal Audit team operates in line with governance 
best practices. It reviews and reports to management 
and the Audit Committee about compliance with 
internal controls and the efficiency and effectiveness of 
operations as well as the key process risks. The scope and 
authority of the Internal Audit division is derived from 
the Internal Audit Charter, duly approved by the Audit 
Committee; and Anti-fraud programs including whistle 
blower mechanisms are operative across the Company.
•	
Adopted three Line of Defence model. The 1st line of 
defence, ensures implementation of desired Internal 
Controls and Risk Management practices. The 2nd line 
of defence assist in determination of Risk Capacity, 
Appetite, Process and Procedures and facilitate 
oversight, monitoring and reporting on Risk and 
Controls. The 3rd line of defence is the internal audit, 
which provides Independent and Objective assurance 
to the Audit Committee on overall effectiveness of Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Compliance activities 
and recommendations on improvements required.
•	
An ongoing program, for the reinforcement of the Tata 
Code of Conduct is prevalent across the organization. 
The Code covers integrity of financial reporting, ethical 
conduct, regulatory compliance, conflicts of interest’s 
review and reporting of concerns.
The Board takes responsibility for the overall process of 
risk management throughout the organization. Through an 
Enterprise Risk Management program, our business units and 
corporate functions address risks through an institutionalized 
approach aligned to our objectives. This is facilitated 
by internal audit. The Business risk is managed through 
cross functional involvement and communication across 
businesses. The results of the risk assessment are presented 
to the senior management. The Risk Management Committee 
reviews business risk areas covering operational, financial, 
strategic and regulatory risks.
There have been no changes in our internal control over 
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered 
by this annual report that have materially affected, or are 
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over 
financial reporting.
During FY24, we assessed the effectiveness of the Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting and has determined that 
our Internal Control over Financial Reporting as at March 31, 
2024, is effective.

More When One with its four culture pillars – Be Bold, Solve 
Together, Own it & Be Empathetic, serves as a guiding force 
for to take larger strides in curating a desirable employee

DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION
Refer Page 96 for culture initiative 
 Jaguar Land Rover
We believe we must reflect the diversity of the world in 
which our colleagues and clients live so that we can truly 
thrive and create a culture where our people feel supported 
equitably, can be their authentic selves, and allow fresh ideas, 
challenges, and opinions to be heard.
To do this we are taking action to make tangible impact, 
measured against three internal targets:
Target 1: Globally, 30% of all senior leaders to be female, by 
2026. FY24 performance is 7%.
Target 2: In the UK, 15% of all senior leaders to be from a 
Black, Asian or Mixed Ethnicity background, by 2026. FY24 
performance is 18%.
Target 3: Globally, for our Inclusion Index to reach over 80 by 
2026 FY24 performance is 80,
Our global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policy highlights our 
zero tolerance approach to bullying, harassment, and other 
negative behaviours.
Since their appointment in 2022 our two Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion Board co-sponsors, Barbara Bergmeier and François 
Dossa, have been determined to continue our progress and 
to collaborate to make an environment where we all feel 
proud to work and ensure diversity, equity and inclusion 
is represented at the highest levels of our business. This 
year they have both been taking part in reverse mentoring 
to further their understanding of different characteristics, 
supported the Kaleidoscope Trust, talked on the Rugby World 
Cup panel with our Defender Trailblazers, held many listening 
circles and attended all network events. They are supported 
by fourteen global colleague network groups, ensuring that 
colleagues have spaces to share their lived experiences, 
and learn from one another’s experiences. These have been 
instrumental in showcasing the power of allyship within our 
organisation. In FY25 we will be focusing on a digital learning 
roll out across all our regions outside the UK.
In September 2023, we held our first Global DE&I Summit 
which saw 600 people in person, over 4,000 people online 
in 26 countries with 17 global inclusion hubs. This event was 
a celebration of the progress made to date in changing our 
culture, and also introduced the term ‘equity’ to our business. 
This has cemented our ambition to ensure that all colleagues 
are supported.
External Partnerships
We continue to partner with the Business Disability Forum, 
working with them to inform our disability strategy. This 
will continue to be a key focus on this in FY25. We have also 
partnered with Amos Bursary in supporting the sponsoring 
of young students of African Caribbean descent from Year 
12, for up to five years whilst they are in higher education. 
As part of this we provide mentoring to help students think 
about what career paths they may want to pursue and 
support their ambitions.
Pay Gap Report - Gender and Ethnicity
In FY24, we continued to improve our pay gap reporting, 
breaking down the ethnicity split further in our second 
ethnicity report. We continue to make strides across both 
gender and ethnicity reporting in the UK. We also released 
our first gender pay gap report for Ireland. This shows our 
commitment to being more transparent both internally and 
externally, and ensures we use data to drive our actions and 
decision making.
We are committed to fostering a more diverse, equitable, 
inclusive and unified culture that is representative of our 
colleagues, our clients, and the society in which we live.

Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Policy of the Company is designed to 
create a high-performance culture. It enables the Company 
to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve results. 
Our business model promotes customer centricity and 
requires employee mobility to address project needs. 
The remuneration policy supports such mobility through 
pay models that are compliant to local regulations. In each 
country where the Company operates, the remuneration 
structure is tailored to the regulations, practices and 
benchmarks 
prevalent 
in 
the 
automotive 
industry. 
The detailed Remuneration Policy for Directors, KMP and 
other employees, in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations is available on the 
website  at  https://www.tatamotors.com/wp-content/
uploads/2023/11/remuneration-policy.pdf 
The Company pays remuneration by way of salary, benefits, 
perquisites and allowances (fixed component) and commission 
(variable component) to its ED. Annual increments are 
recommended by the NRC within the salary scale approved 
by the Board and Members and which are effective from 
April 1, each year.

The remuneration by way of commission to the NEDs 
is decided by the Board of Directors and distributed to 
them based on their participation and contribution at 
the Board and Committee meetings and performance

of ₹5.50 crore to the NEDs/IDs of the Company for 
FY23 which was 0.20% of the profit after tax for that

The Company had on November 9, 2022 conveyed its intention 
to voluntarily delist the American Depository Shares (‘ADSs’), 
from the NYSE, effective close of trading hours on the NYSE 
on January 23, 2023. As a consequence thereof, the ADSs 
stopped trading on NYSE and no over-the-counter trading of 
the ADSs in the United States was allowed due to regulatory 
restrictions under the Indian law. Necessary intimation in this 
regard was communicated to the stock exchanges in India as 
well as to the respective ADS holders.
The ADS holders who wished to convert their ADSs into 
underlying Ordinary Shares of the Company, surrendered 
their ADSs to Citibank NA (‘the Depositary’) on or before July 
24, 2023 and received Ordinary Shares in the Company in the 
ratio of 5 Ordinary Shares of ₹2 each for every 1 ADS held 
by them.
Subsequently, in accordance with the terms described in 
the Notice of termination of ADS facility and as provided 
in the Deposit Agreement, Citibank NA sold the remaining 
underlying Ordinary Shares corresponding to the outstanding 
ADSs and distributed the proceeds thereof to the ADS holders 
who have not converted their ADSs into Ordinary Shares in 
the Company, subject to deduction of prescribed withholding 
tax, as applicable.

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of 
Tata Motors Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding 
Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and 
its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), its 
associates and its joint ventures and joint operations, which 
comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, 
and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including 
other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows 
for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, including material accounting policies 
and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 
“the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based on the 
consideration of reports of the other auditors on separate/
consolidated financial statements/financial information 
of such subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and joint 
operations as were audited by the other auditors, the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) 
in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its 
associates, joint ventures and joint operations as at 31 March 
2024, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive 
income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated 
cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group, its associates, joint ventures and 
joint operations in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant 
provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We 
believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with 
the consideration of reports of the other auditors referred 
to in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” section below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment and based on the consideration of reports of other 
auditors on separate/consolidated financial statements of 
components audited by them, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the 
current period. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

auditor of Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC ( hereinafter referred to as JLR Group)
See Note 2(i) and 7 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The JLR Group holds a significant amount of property, plant 
and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets on 
its balance sheet and the cash generating unit of which these 
assets form a part is at risk of being impaired.
In particular, there are execution risks associated with the JLR 
Group’s transition to Battery Electric Vehicles (‘BEV’) resulting 
from its previously announced ‘Reimagine’ strategy and 
economic uncertainity resulting from geo- political factor that 
could impact demand or supply.
The effect of these matters is that, as part of component 
auditor’s risk assessment, the component auditor determined 
that the calculation of the value in use of CGU to which 
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and right-
of use assets are allocated has a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes 
greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a 
whole, and possibly many times that amount.
The component auditor performed the tests below rather than 
seeking to rely on any of the JLR Group’s controls because the nature 
of the balance is such that component auditor would expect to obtain 
audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described. 
Component auditor’s procedures included:
•	
Historical accuracy: Evaluated historical forecasting 
accuracy of discounted cash flow forecasts, including 
key assumptions, by comparing them to the actual 
results. Key assumptions include volumes, variable proﬁt 
, execution risk adjustments, terminal value capital 
expenditure and discount rate.
•	
Historical comparison: Assessed the appropriateness of 
the JLR Group’s key assumptions used in the discounted 
cash flow forecasts by comparing those, where 
appropriate, to historical trends.
•	
Component auditor’s industry expertise: Assessed the 
appropriateness of the JLR Group’s estimated value in 
use amount by comparing the implied trading multiples 
to market multiples of comparative companies with 
the assistance of their valuation specialists. Assessed 
and critically challenged the appropriateness of the JLR 
Group’s assumptions used in the cash flow projections 
by comparing key assumptions to relevant internal 
and extenral data sources. Compared the JLR Group’s 
discount rate and long-term growth rate to external 
benchmark data and comparative companies and re-
performed the discount rate calculation using the 
capital asset pricing model with the assistance of their 
valuation specialists.
•	
Sensitivity analysis: Performed a sensitivity analysis on 
key assumptions.
•	
Comparing valuations: Assessed the JLR Group’s 
reconciliation 
between 
the 
estimated 
market 
capitalisation of the JLR Group, by reference to the 
overall market capitalisation of the Holding Company 
and compared to the estimated recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit.
•	
Update to period end: Assessed whether there had 
been events having a signiﬁcant effect on value in use 
measurement after the date of the impairment test (31 
January 2024) but before the end of the reporting period.
•	
Impairment reversal: Assessed whether the JLR 
Group’s estimated value in use was indicative of an 
impairment reversal.
•	
Assessing transparency: Assessed whether the JLR 
Group’s disclosures about sensitivity relating to key 
assumptios on the valuation of property, plant and 
equipment, intangible assets, right-of- use non-current 
assets are adequate.

See Note 22 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
JLR Group previously had significant unused tax losses for 
which no deferred tax asset was recognised. These losses 
arose mostly in the UK. Improved UK trading has led to UK 
taxable profits becoming available which, when taken with 
probable, forecast UK taxable profits are sufficient to fully 
utilise those past UK taxable losses. A deferred tax asset has 
been recognised in the current year in respect of remaining, 
past UK taxable losses.
There is inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting future 
taxable profits, which determines the extent to which 
deferred tax assets are ,or are not, recognised.
There is judgement involved in determining the extent to 
which it is probable that future profits will arise to utilise the 
net deferred tax asset.
The effect of these matters is that, as part of component 
auditor’s risk assessment, component auditor determined 
that the recoverable amount of deferred tax assets has a high 
degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of 
reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times 
that amount.
The component auditor performed the tests below rather 
than seeking to rely on any of the JLR Group’s controls because 
the nature of the balance is such that component auditor 
would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through 
the detailed procedures described. Component auditor’s 
procedures included:
•	
Assessing forecasts: Component auditor’s work over 
the JLR Group’s forecasts is principally based on the 
work described in the ‘Impairment of property plant 
and equipment, intangible, and right-of use non-current 
assets’ key audit matter reported above.
•	
Component auditor’s tax expertise: Component auditor 
involved their tax specialists to assist in assessing the 
recoverability of the tax losses against the forecast 
future taxable profits, taking into account the JLR Group’s 
tax position, the timing of forecast taxable profits and 
component auditor’s knowledge and experience of the 
application of relavant tax legislations.
•	
Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of 
the JLR Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the 
recognition of deferred tax assets to changes in key 
assumptions reflected in the inherent risk.
Recognition of deferred tax asset on unused tax losses
See Note 22 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
As detailed in note 22 of the consoldiated financial statements, 
during the year, the Holding Company has recognized deferred 
tax assets (‘DTA’) of Rs. 1,248.90 crores on brought forward 
business losses.
The Company assesses its ability to recover the DTA at the 
end of each reporting period which is based on an assessment 
of the probability that future taxable income will be available 
against which the carried forward unused tax losses can 
be utilised.
As per the assessment done by the Company, it expects to 
earn sufficient taxable profits based on improved business 
performance and reduction in interest costs in line with the 
plans for a reduction in net debt in subsequent years which 
enables the Company to utilize its carried forward unused tax 
losses within permissible time as per income tax provisions.
Recognition of DTA involves the assessment of its recoverability 
within the permissible time frame requiring a significant 
estimate of the financial projections, and availability of 
sufficient future taxable income. Considering the history of 
losses, complexity, and judgment involved in the assessment 
of recovery of deferred tax assets, the matter is considered to 
be a key audit matter.
In view of the significance of the matter, we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence.
Test of Controls:
We tested the design, implementation, and operating 
effectiveness of management review controls over the key 
inputs and assumptions used to produce future projections 
of taxable profits.
Test of details:
•	
Evaluated the historical forecasting accuracy of key 
assumptions such as volume, revenue and profit before 
tax, by comparing them to the actual results.
•	
Read minutes of meetings to verify that the budget has 
been approved by the Board of Directors.
•	
Performed sensitivity analysis on key inputs and 
assumptions, to independently estimate a range for 
comparison and its impact on future taxable income.
•	
Checked arithmetical accuracy of calculation of 
deferred tax.

Valuation of defined benefit plan obligations
See Notes 40 (iii) to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company operates an exempt pension scheme (‘Scheme’) 
for its employees. Based on the management’s assessment, 
the exempt status of the Scheme calls for an automatic 
cancellation at the end of three consecutive years of losses, 
which the Company has had over financial years 2019-20, 
2020-21 and 2021-22. Further the Company had applied to the 
Employee Provident Fund Organization (‘EPFO’) to surrender 
the scheme in 2019. However, the said application has not 
been accepted by EPFO till date.
Separately, on November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court in petition by different individuals ruled that those that 
were members of a statutory pension fund as on September 
1, 2014, can exercise a joint option with their employer to 
contribute to their fund beyond the statutory limit and opt 
to draw pension out of it basis their last 5 years average 
salary. Accordingly, the Company has determined the list of 
employees who have opted for the above option given by 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court and has approved the same on 
the EPFO’s portal along with a communication to the EPFO 
that the Company shall fund the additional liability estimated 
through actuarial valuation.
While the Company believes that their scheme should now be 
handled by the EPFO, since the same has not been accepted, 
the Company has involved an actuarial expert to evaluate 
pension liability per Ind AS-19 – Employee Benefits.
Significant effort has gone into interpreting the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court Order and determining the amount, including 
the completeness of the details considered, that would 
have significant effect on estimating the additional pension 
liability. The risk is that the judgements used for valuation 
are inappropriate and could lead to an error resulting into an 
inappropriate valuation of additional pension liabilities.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence.
Test of Controls:
Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of key controls over the assumptions and membership data 
used in valuation of defined benefit obligation (pension).
Test of details:
•	
Evaluated the competence, capability and objectivity of 
the Company’ external actuarial expert who performed 
the valuation of additional pension liability.
•	
Assessed the assumptions used by management’s 
external actuarial expert in valuing the amount of 
additional pension liability.
•	
Evaluated the management’s assessment with respect to 
interpretation of Supreme Court order for determination 
of pensionable salary.
•	
Tested the underlying base data for employees who 
applied for exercising the joint option, which was used 
for valuation of additional pension liability.
•	
Evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures 
with respect to additional pension liability.

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Capitalisation of product engineering assets, as reported by the component auditor of JLR Group
See Note 6 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
JLR Group has historically capitalised a high proportion of 
product development cost and there is a key judgement in 
determining whether the nature of the product engineering 
costs satisfy the criteria for capitalisation to ‘Intangible 
Assets, Product Development In Progress’, when this 
capitalisation should commence, and whether capitalisation 
should continue.
The judgement of whether capitalisation should continue 
requires the satisfaction of a number of Ind AS 38 
capitalisation criteria and a key judgement in assessing 
whether development projects will generate probable future 
economic benefit. There are a number of projects which met 
the capitalisation gateway prior to this financial year and 
which have incurred material levels of development spend 
in the current financial year. These projects include those 
related to the Group’s transition to Battery Electric Vehicles 
(BEV) resulting from its previously announced “Reimagine” 
strategy. This has elevated the risk in relation to the on- 
going capitalisation of costs. Few projects have commenced 
capitalisation for the first time in the current year. This has 
reduced the risk in relation to the current year timing of 
capitalisation judgement such that it does not form part of 
our key audit matter in the current year.
It is also noted that there is a risk of fraud around the allocation 
of directly attributable expenditure to the correct project 
codes to ensure appropriate costs are being capitalised.
The consolidated financial statements (note-6) disclose 
an amount of Rs. 1,564.89 crores to represent what the 
reduction in the amount capitalised would be if the value of 
central overheads had not been identified by the Directors as 
being eligible for capitalisation.
The audit procedure applied by the auditor of the component 
(JLR Group) included:
•	
Control operation: Tested controls including in relation
to the Directors’ assessment as to whether product
engineering costs are eligible for capitalisation.
•	
Personnel interviews: Corroborated judgements made
by the Directors around the continuation of capitalisation
of product engineering costs through discussions with
project level staff.
•	
Component auditor’s sector experience: Critically
assessed the Directors’ judgements regarding product
engineering costs identified by the Directors as being
eligible for capitalisation against both the accounting
standards and their experience of practical application
of these standards in other companies.
•	
Consider 
altenatives: 
Critically 
assessed 
internal
consistency between assumptions used in the JLR Group’s
assessment of economic viability on key development
projects and assumptions used in cash flow forecasts in
calculation of JLR Group’s value in use assessed through
component auditor’s response to the significant risk of
Impairment of property plant and equipment, intangible,
and right-of use noncurrent assets
•	
Tests of details: For a sample of product engineering
costs identified by the Directors as being eligible for
capitalisation, agreed that their nature was consistent
with the description of the account to which those
costs were recorded, and the timing of recognition
was appropriate. In addition, component auditor
inspected any reallocations from accounts ineligible for
capitalisation to accounts that are eligible as capitalised
project engineering costs, which component auditor
would consider to meet the criteria of a high risk journal,
and obtained evidence to confirm appropriateness.
•	
Assessing 
transparency: 
Assessed 
the 
adequacy
of the JLR Group’s disclosures in respect of the key
judgements made.

Subjective valuation
Small changes in the key assumptions applied to valuation 
of the liabilities, being the discount rate, inflation rate and 
mortality/life expectancy used to value the JLR Group’s 
pension obligation (before deducting scheme assets) would 
have a significant effect on the amount of the JLR Group’s 
net pension surplus. The risk is that these assumptions are 
inappropriate resulting in an inappropriate valuation of 
plan liabilities.
The audit procedure applied by the auditor of the component 
(JLR Group) included:
•	
Control Operation: Tested controls operating over the
assumptions applied in the valuation and inspected the
JLR Group’s annual validation of the assumptions used
by its actuarial expert. Tested the JLR Group’s control
operating over selection and monitoring of its acturial
expert for competence and objectivity.

See Notes 43A(iv) and 43B(d)(ii) to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Subjective estimate
Under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments, allowance for 
loan losses are determined using expected credit loss (ECL) 
estimation model. The estimation of Expected Credit Loss 
(ECL) on financial instruments involves significant judgements 
and estimates. The key areas where component auditor 
identified greater levels of management judgement and 
therefore increased levels of audit focus in the estimation of 
ECLs are:
•	
Data inputs - The application of ECL model requires 
several data inputs. This increases the risk of 
completeness and accuracy of the data that has been 
used to create assumptions in the model.
•	
Model estimations - Inherently judgmental models 
are used to estimate ECL which involves determining 
Probabilities of Default (“PD”), Loss Given Default 
(“’LGD’’), and Exposures at Default (“EAD”). The PD and 
the LGD are the key drivers of estimation complexity in 
ECL and as a result are considered the most significant 
judgmental aspect of the Company’s modelling approach.
•	
Qualitative adjustments - Adjustments to the model-
driven ECL results are recorded by component 
management to address known impairment model 
limitations or emerging trends as well as risks not 
captured by models. These adjustments are inherently 
uncertain and significant management judgement is 
involved in estimating these amounts.
The audit procedures applied by the auditor of the 
component(TMFL) included:
Design/Controls
The component auditor performed end to end process 
walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and 
control used in ECL processes. Tested the relevant manual 
(including spresheet controls), general IT and application 
controls over the key system used in ECL process.
Key aspects of controls testing involved following:
•	
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the 
key controls over the completeness and accuracy of the 
key inputs, data and assumptions into the Ind AS 109 
impairment models
•	
Testing the ‘Governance Framework’ controls over 
validation, implementation and model monitoring inline 
with Reserve Bank of India guidance.
•	
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the key 
controls over the application of the staging criteria.
•	
Testing 
key 
controls 
relating 
to 
selection 
and 
implementation of material macro-economic variables 
and the controls over the scenario selection and 
application of probability weights.
•	
Testing management’s controls over authorisation 
and calculation of post model adjustments and 
management overlays.

See Notes 43A(iv) and 43B(d)(ii) to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The underlying forecasts and assumptions used in the 
estimates of impairment loss allowance are subject to 
uncertainties which are often outside the control of the 
TMF Holding Limited Group (TMF Group). Given the size of 
loan portfolio relative to the balance sheet and the impact 
of impairment allowance on the financial information, 
component auditor has considered this as a key audit matter.
Disclosures: The disclosures regarding the Group’s application 
of Ind AS 109 are key to explaining the key judgements and 
material inputs to the Ind AS 109 ECL results.
•	
Testing management’s controls on compliance with Ind 
AS 109 disclosures related to ECL
•	
Testing key controls operating over the information 
technology system in relation to loan impairment 
including system access and system change management, 
program development and computer operations.
Test of details
Key aspects of testing included:
•	
Sample testing over key inputs, data and assumptions 
impacting ECL calculations to assess the completeness, 
accuracy and relevance of data and reasonableness 
of 
economic 
forecasts, 
weights, 
and 
model 
assumptions applied.
•	
Model calculations testing through re- performance, 
where possible.
•	
Test of details of post model adjustments, considering 
the size and complexity of management overlays, in 
order to assess the reasonableness of the adjustments by 
challenging key assumptions, inspecting the calculation 
methodology and tracing a sample of the data used back 
to source data.
•	
Assessing disclosures - Assessed whether the disclosures 
appropriately disclose and address the uncertainty which 
exists when determining ECL. In addition, the auditors 
assessed whether the disclosure of the key judgements 
and assumptions made was sufficiently clear.
Other Information
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, but does not include the financial statements and 
auditor’s reports thereon. The annual report is expected to 
be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ 
Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these 
consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements 
of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state 
of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive 
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group including its associates, 
joint ventures and joint operations in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group 
and of its associates, joint ventures and joint operations are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records

the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair 
view and are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the 
Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, 
as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group and of its associates, joint 
ventures and joint operations are responsible for assessing 
the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associates, joint ventures and joint 
operations are responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Group and its 
associates and joint ventures and joint operations to 
cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial statements/financial information of such 
entities or business activities within the Group and 
its associates and joint ventures and joint operations 
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of the financial 
statements/financial information of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements 
of which we are the independent auditors. For the 
other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by other auditors, 
such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audits carried out 
by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further

Matters” in this audit report.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal

requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(E) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section 
of our report of even date)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Tata Motors Limited (hereinafter referred to 
as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 31 
March 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements of the Holding 
Company and such companies incorporated in India under 
the Act which is its subsidiary companies, its associate 
companies, its joint venture companies and joint operation 
companies, as of that date.
In our opinion and based on the consideration of reports 
of the other auditors on internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements/financial information of 
subsidiary companies, associate companies, joint venture 
companies and joint operation companies, as were audited by 
the other auditors, the Holding Company and such companies 
incorporated in India which is its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies, its joint venture companies and joint 
operation companies, have, in all material respects, adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements and such internal financial controls were operating 
effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by such companies considering the essential 
components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Company's Management and the Board of 
Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the respective company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company's policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements were established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the 
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors  of the relevant 
subsidiary companies, associate companies, joint venture 
companies and joint operation companies in terms of their 
reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements include those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly

2023-24
276"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company 
are being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements/financial 
information in so far as it relates to two subsidiary companies, 
two step-down subsidiaries and one joint operation company, 
which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the 
corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies 
incorporated in India.
The internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements/financial information in so far as it relates to 
four associate companies and one joint venture company, 
which are companies incorporated in India and included 
in these consolidated financial statements, have not been 
audited either by us or by other auditors. In our opinion and 
according to the information and explanations given to us 
by the Management, such unaudited subsidiary companies, 
associate companies and joint venture companies are not 
material to the Holding Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

referred to as (“the Company” or “Tata Motors”), 
designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of 
automotive vehicles. The Company provides financing 
for the vehicles sold by dealers of the Company in certain 
markets. The Company also manufactures engines for 
industrial applications, aggregates such as axles and 
transmissions for commercial vehicles and factory 
automation equipment, and provides information 
technology services."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"Tata Motors Limited is a public limited company 
incorporated and domiciled in India and has its 
registered office at Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. As at 
March 31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited, together with 
its subsidiaries and joint venture owns 46.29% of the 
Ordinary shares and 7.66% of ‘A’ Ordinary shares of the 
Company and has the ability to significantly influence 
the Company’s operation."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"The Company’s subsidiaries includes the Jaguar Land 
Rover business (referred to as JLR or Jaguar Land Rover)."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"The consolidated financial statements were approved by 
the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May 
10, 2024.
2.	 Material accounting policies"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"These financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with Ind AS as notified under the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015 read with Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”) as amended from time to time."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on historical cost basis except for 
certain financial instruments which are measured 
at fair value at the end of each reporting period 
as explained in the accounting policies below. 
These consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Indian Rupees (INR), which is also 
the Company’s functional currency. All amounts 
have been rounded to the nearest crores, unless 
otherwise indicated."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"The consolidated financial statements include Tata 
Motors Limited and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries 
are entities controlled by the Company. Control 
exists when the Company (a) has power over 
the investee, (b) it is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and (c) has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power to direct relevant 
activities of the investee. Relevant activities are 
those activities that significantly affect an entity’s 
returns. The Company reassesses whether or not 
it controls an investee if facts and circumstances 
indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements listed above. In assessing 
control, potential voting rights that currently are 
exercisable and other contractual arrangements 
that may influence control are taken into account. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the effective date of 
acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, 
as appropriate."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"Inter-company 
transactions 
and 
balances 
including unrealised profits are eliminated in full 
on consolidation."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"Non-controlling interests in the net assets 
(excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries 
are identified separately from the Company’s 
equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders 
may be initially measured either at fair value or 
at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate 
share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. The choice of measurement basis 
is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interests is the amount of 
those interests at initial recognition plus the non-
controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes 
in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed 
to non-controlling interests even if it results in the 
non-controlling interest having a deficit balance. 
Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries 
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted 
for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of 
the Company’s interests and the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 
relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference 
between the amount by which the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly 
in equity and attributed to owners of the Company. 
When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, 
the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the 
difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair 
value of consideration received and the fair value of 
any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying 
amount of the assets (including goodwill), and 
liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling 
interests. Amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary 
are accounted for (i.e., reclassified to profit or 
loss) in the same manner as would be required if 
the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. 
The fair value of any investment retained in the 
former subsidiary at the date when control is lost 
is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition

cost on initial recognition of an investment in an 
associate or jointly controlled entity."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which 
two or more parties have joint control. Joint control 
is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"Certain of the Company’s activities, are conducted 
through 
joint 
operations, 
which 
are 
joint 
arrangements whereby the parties that have joint 
control of the arrangement have rights to the 
assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating 
to the arrangement. The Company recognises, in 
the consolidated financial statements, its share 
of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 
these joint operations incurred jointly with the 
other partners, along with its share of income from 
the sale of the output and any assets, liabilities 
and expenses that it has incurred in relation to the 
joint operation."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement 
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 
The results, assets and liabilities of a joint venture 
are incorporated in these financial statements 
using the equity method of accounting as 
described below."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"Associates are those entities over which the 
Company has significant influence. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but is not control or joint control those policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the 
Company holds 20 percent or more of the voting 
power of the investee. If accounting policies of 
associates differ from those adopted by the Group, 
the accounting policies of associates are aligned 
with those of the Group. The results, assets and 
liabilities of associates are incorporated in these 
financial statements using the equity method of 
accounting as described below."

accounted investees)"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"An interest in an associate or joint venture is 
accounted for using the equity method from 
the date the investee becomes an associate or a 
joint venture and are recognised initially at cost. 
The carrying value of investment in associates 
and joint ventures includes goodwill identified 
on date of acquisition, net of any accumulated 
impairment losses. The consolidated financial 
statements include the Company’s share of profits 
or losses, other comprehensive income and equity 
movements of equity accounted investments, from 
the date that significant influence or joint control 
commences until the date that significant influence 
or joint control ceases. When the Company’s 
share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity 
accounted investment, the carrying amount of that 
interest (including any long-term interests in the 
nature of net investments) is reduced to nil and the 
recognition of further losses is discontinued except 
to the extent that the Company has incurred 
constructive or legal obligations or has made 
payments on behalf of the investee."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"When the Company transacts with an associate or 
joint venture of the Company, unrealised profits 
and losses are eliminated to the extent of the 
Company’s interest in its associate or joint venture."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"Dividends are recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are 
accounted for using the acquisition method. 
Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit 
or loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that 
meet the conditions for recognition are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date, except 
certain assets and liabilities that are required to be 
measured as per the applicable standard."

assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is 
recognised as goodwill. Excess of the Company’s 
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent

recognised, after reassessment of fair value of net 
assets acquired, in the Capital Reserve."

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"The Company and JLR have assessed their projected 
cash flows over the going concern assessment 
period. In developing these forecasts, the Company 
and JLR have modelled a base case. The base case 
uses the most recent Board-approved forecasts 
that include the going concern assessment period; 
a steady improvement in wholesale volumes, with 
associated increases in EBIT in the going concern 
assessment period compared to the previous 
12 months reflecting the removal of supply and 
production constraints that existed in previous 
periods and eased over the course of the year 
ended March 31, 2024."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"For the Company, the base case has been further 
sensitized using more severe but plausible scenarios 
considering external market commentaries and 
other factors impacting the global economy and 
automotive industry."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to financial statements,"JLR has carried out a reverse stress test against the 
base case to determine the decline in wholesale 
volumes over a twelve-month period that would 
result in a"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"liquidity level that breaches the GBP 1 
billion"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"liquidity financing covenant. The reverse 
stress test assumes optimisation of production to 
maximise production of higher margin products. 
In order to reach a"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"liquidity level that breaches 
covenants, it would require a sustained decline in 
wholesale volumes of 62% compared to the base 
case over a 12-month period. The reverse stress 
test reflects the variable profit impact of the 
wholesale volume decline, and assumes all other 
assumptions are held in line with the base case. It 
does not reflect other potential upside measures 
that could be taken in such a reduced volume 
scenario; nor any new funding."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"JLR does not consider this scenario to be plausible 
given that the stress test volumes are significantly 
lower than the volumes achieved during both the 
peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst 
quarter of semiconductor shortages. JLR has a 
strong order bank and is confident that it can 
significantly exceed reverse stress test volumes."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"JLR has also considered the impact of severe but 
plausible downside scenarios, including scenarios 
that reflect a decrease in variable profit per unit 
compared with the base case to include additional 
increases in material and other related production 
costs. The expected wholesale volumes under all of 
these scenarios are higher than under the reverse 
stress test."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Based on the evaluation described above, 
management believes that the Company and JLR 
have sufficient financial resources available to it at 
the date of approval of these financial statements 
and that it will be able to continue as a ‘going 
concern’ in the foreseeable future and for a period 
upto at least twelve months from the date of 
authorisation of these financial statement."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with Ind AS requires management to 
make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that 
affect the application of accounting policies and 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, 
expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of these financial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues and

a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company 
assesses whether:"

The contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be

substantive substation right, then the asset is not identified;"

In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company

The Company has the right to operate the asset; or"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"•	
The Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purposes it will be used."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"As a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for 
any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Company has not used this practical 
expedient. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use 
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated dilapidation 
costs, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the straight-line 
method over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the period of lease. If ownership of the leased asset 
is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease 
payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straightline basis over the expected useful life of the leased asset."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement 
date, discounted using, the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s 
incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is 
re measured when there is a change in future lease payments. The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value 
assets (lease of assets worth less than ₹ 0.03 crores) . The Company associates the lease payments associated with 
these leases as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Lease payments include fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable 
under a residual value guarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to 
exercise that option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term considered reflects that 
the Company shall exercise termination option. The Company also recognises a right of use asset which comprises 
of amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated 
dilapidation costs.

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based 
on contractual terms and substance of the lease arrangement. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net 
investment in the leases. Finance income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of 
return on the Company’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial 
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased 
asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"(B)	 The Company leases a number of buildings, plant and equipment, IT hardware and software assets, certain of which 
have a renewal and/or purchase option in the normal course of the business. Extension and termination options 
are included in a number of leases across the Company. The majority of extension and termination options held are 
exercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement 
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether it 
is reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within its 
control. It is recognised that there is potential for lease term assumptions to change in the future and this will continue 
to be monitored by the Company where relevant. The Company’s leases mature between 2025 and 2052."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"When measuring lease liability, the Company discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate. The

5% long-term growth rates. The management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would

supportable. If not, the change in the useful-life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis."

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The impairment assessment determined that the CGU recoverable value exceeded the carrying amount by ₹68,267.03 
crores (GBP 6,500 million) (2023:₹15,246.72 crores (GBP 1,500  million) and therefore no impairment was identified. The 
increase in headroom has largely been driven by the improved performance experienced over the course of the year 
together with the progress made towards implementation of the business strategy. It was further determined that this 
increase did not require the reversal of the previously recorded impairment loss as the underlying drivers for the increased 
headroom do not support a reversal, after considering the unwind of the discount rate and the impact of depreciation and 
amortisation of impaired assets."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"JLR has considered it appropriate to undertake the impairment assessment with reference to the approved business plan 
that was in effect as at the assessment date. The business plan includes a five-year cash flow forecast and contains growth 
rates that are primarily a function of the JLR’s Cycle Plan assumptions, historic performance and management’s expectation 
of future market developments through to 2028/29."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"In estimating the future cash flows management have given due consideration to the inherent uncertainty of forecast 
information and have adjusted some of the assumptions in the business plan to take into account possible variations in 
the amount or timing of the cashflows. In doing so, management has incorporated execution risks associated with our 
‘Reimagine’ strategy and the transition to electrified powertrain into the VIU, as well as other risks that may impact future 
cash flows."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"JLR recognises that the potential impact of climate risk to areas such as supply chain, operations, and material and compliance 
costs may result in variations to the timing and amounts of future cash flows. As such climate risk is incorporated into the 
development of our forecast cash flows in the VIU by reference to our climate change risk assessment. These risks are 
principally reflected by the risk adjustments related to the variable profit and volumes which would be most affected by 
climate change events, for example, scarcity of certain commodities driving up costs and therefore adversely impacting 
variable profit."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The assessment of impairment is based on forecasts of future cashflows which are inherently uncertain and are developed 
using informed assumptions such as historical trends and market information. The key assumptions are:"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"ii)	
involve a significant amount of judgement and estimation; and"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"iii)	
drive significant changes to the recoverable amount when flexed under reasonably possible outcomes."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Variable profit per unit and volumes – The approach to determining the forecast variable profit per unit and volumes 
is based on consideration of historical performance, the order bank, profit optimisation efforts and Group Cycle Plan 
assumptions, along with the impact of risks on future cashflows discussed above. A small change in either assumption may 
have a significant impact to future cashflows and for this reason, as well as the impact of risks associated with supply and 
inflationary pressures on variable profit and volumes, the directors consider variable profit per unit and volumes to be 
key assumptions. Further, the variable profit per unit and volumes included in the business plan are largely driven by an 
updated portfolio, which includes estimates and judgements related to the transition to electrified powertrain, including 
the introduction of new Jaguar."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Terminal value capital expenditure – the five year cash flows timing and amount are based on the latest Cycle Plan. The 
terminal value is based on the best estimate of a maintenance level of capital expenditure which has been derived from 
depreciation and amortisation expectations and funding requirements in responses to longer-term industry trends and 
risks informed by those listed above, which are anticipated in the VIU calculation. Due to the judgement and estimation 
involved in the calculation of terminal value capital expenditure, as well as the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to any 
change in the value, JLR consider this to be a key assumption."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Discount rate – the approach to determining the discount rate is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a market 
participant after tax cost of debt. These inputs are based on a typical build up approach, calculated using country specific 
premiums without size premium and with an unlevered equity Beta with reference to industry peers. The decrease in the 
year has mainly been driven by a decrease to the country risk premium. The discount rate is regarded as a key assumption 
as it is the rate which drives the discounted cashflows used to determine the VIU of the CGU primarily due to the level of 
judgement and estimation involved and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to small changes in the percentage.

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The VIU assessment is sensitive to certain assumptions, such as Sales, General and Administration (SG&A) costs which 
are not considered to be key assumptions, because significant adverse changes are not considered reasonably possible 
based on the forecasting methodology, where historical performance has been adjusted for expected future cost savings. 
Similarly, certain assumptions which involve greater judgement and estimation, such as growth rate, but for which even 
relatively significant changes have a limited impact on the assessment are not regarded as key assumptions."

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Given the inherent uncertainty about the timing and amount of any change in key assumptions, as well as the significant 
portion of the recoverable amount related to the VIU terminal value, JLR consider a net impact on terminal period cash 
flows to be the best means of indicating the sensitivity of key assumptions."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"JLR considers the variable profit and volumes assumptions to be interdependent as movement in one assumption will 
impact the other, impacting the overall variable profit. For example, the profit optimisation efforts discussed above will 
likely result in higher average variable profit per unit with lower volumes whereas a focus on volumes would likely see 
a reduction in the average variable profit per unit. Consequently, the terminal value variable profit sensitivity below 
incorporates sensitivity in volumes via the impact on variable profit."

During the year ended March 31, 2024, JLR has recognised deferred tax assets of ₹7,093.77 crores (£ 659 million) 
in relation to unused tax losses on the basis that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The key assumptions to which the forecasts of 
the probable level of future taxable profits are most sensitive are wholesale volumes, variable profit per unit 
and investment."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"4.	
In previous years, JLR reviewed tax assets and concluded that it was not probable that future taxable profits 
would be available against which the assets could be utilised, and accordingly had not recognised a net deferred 
tax asset in respect of those assets. In making this assessment in previous periods it was considered that JLR 
had consistently generated taxable losses in recent years, was continuing to generate taxable losses in the then 
current period and was forecast to generate some taxable income in future periods that may not have been 
sufficient to utilise the related tax assets. During the year ended March 31, 2024 there has been a significant 
improvement in performance. Sufficient taxable profits are forecast to be generated within the 5-year detailed 
business plan to utilise all of the net deferred tax asset prior to consideration of restrictions on the amount of 
UK tax losses and UK tax depreciation that can be offset against UK taxable profits each year. As a result of these 
UK tax rules the recoverability of all of the net UK deferred tax asset will continue beyond our 5-year detailed 
business plan. The forecasts are based on the Company’s impairment model. The sensitivity analysis applied 
to the impairment model as described in does not impact the ability to recover the UK deferred tax asset in 
full. When the tax assets are utilised in future years it is expected that the impact will be recorded within the 
underlying tax charge for that year to match with the similar classification of the corresponding taxable profits 
of that year."

that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The estimated liability for product warranties are recognized when products are sold or when new warranty 
programmes are initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and

typically up to six years and for batteries in Electric Vehicles warranty period is typically up to eight years. The Company 
also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle fault is proven to be a 
supplier’s fault."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier, 
adjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on balance sheet date. Supplier 
reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The restructuring provision includes amounts for third party obligations arising from Group restructuring programmes. 
This includes amounts payable to employees following the announcement of the Group’s Reimagine strategy in 
the year ending 31 March 2021 as well as other Group restructuring programmes. Amounts are also included in 
relation to legal and constructive obligations made to third parties in connection with cancellations under the Group’s 
Reimagine strategy."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The estimated liability for restructuring activities is recognised when the Group has reason to believe there is a legal 
or constructive obligation arising from restructuring actions taken."

for those obligations. These estimates are established using historical experience based on the settlement costs for 
similar liabilities, with proxies being used where no direct comparison exists."

obligations related to supplier claims, motor accident claims, consumer complaints, retailer terminations, employment 
cases and personal injury claims. The decrease in the period is driven predominantly by supplier claims as a result of 
ongoing negotiations and lower levels of new claims."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The provision recognised is based on previous experience, which is considered as a reasonable assumption to estimate 
the final settlement, if any, at the time of the claim. The timing and amount of outflows will vary with decreasing 
uncertainty from the point at which each claim is received to when it is subsequently settled."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Group maintains a provision for non compliance with legal emissions requirements for certain jurisdictions. The 
measurement of the provision considers the sales volume in that jurisdiction and the fee or cost per the applicable 
legislation. The Group aims to mitigate non-compliance risk by purchasing emission credits, participating in emission 
pools or, subject to the terms of the relevant legislation, generating credits by producing and selling compliant vehicles 
in the future. The measurement of the provision at the balance sheet date does not include the impact of credits

certain software products and other automotive products."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of 
variable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products 
are delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks 
and rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably 
assured and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of 
variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the 
contract. The Company operates predominantly on cash and carry basis."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company offers sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary 
depending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for 
as a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue 
recognised when any associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates the expected 
sales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer stock and 
local market conditions."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Revenue is recognised on a bill-and-hold basis where vehicles, for example, are sold to the customer but are 
retained in the Company’s possession at a vehicle holding compound on behalf of the customer ahead of being 
physically transferred to them at a future time. In such arrangements it is ensured that the customer has obtained 
the ultimate control of the product."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"There are certain vehicles which are being given to the customers along with operations and maintenance of the 
same. These are considered as finance leases and accordingly, revenue is recognised at the lease commencement

such services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is in excess of the 
standard offerings to the customer. In such cases, the transaction price allocated towards such maintenance 
service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price and is recognised as a contract 
liability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold 
separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary 
method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company 
estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on 
similar services."

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to corporate bond yields; if plan assets 
under perform compared to the corporate bonds discount rate, this will create or increase a deficit. The defined 
benefit plans hold a significant proportion of equity type assets, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds 
in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"As the plans mature, the Company intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that 
better match the liabilities."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"However, the Company believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the 
supporting group, a level of continuing equity type investments is an appropriate element of the Company’s long 
term strategy to manage the plans efficiently."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an 
increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings and interest rate hedging instruments."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Some of the Company’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities 
(although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against high 
inflation). The plans hold a significant proportion of assets in index linked gilts, together with other inflation hedging 
instruments and also assets which are more closely correlated with inflation. However an increase in inflation will also 
increase the deficit to some degree."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The majority of the plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy 
will result in an increase in the plan’s liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK defined benefit plans, where 
inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy."

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,Classification and measurement – financial liabilities:
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as 
at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, 
are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or 
loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured 
at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognized less, the cumulative 
amount of income recognized."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the 
consideration given or received)."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset 
or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability 
at the measurement date."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted 
in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities 
held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow 
method and other valuation methods"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,(iii)	 Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset 
expires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to 
another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an 
associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also 
recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is 
recognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity 
is transferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value 
through other comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained 
earnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company 
reviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that are 
written off could still be subject to enforcement activities."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged, 
cancelled or has expired.

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on a financial asset that is at amortised 
cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are forward looking and are 
measured in a way that is unbiased and represents a probability-weighted amount, takes into account the time 
value of money (values are discounted using the applicable effective interest rate) and uses reasonable and 
supportable information."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these forward contracts 
in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also uses interest 
rate swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate liabilities i.e. 
when interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair 
value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are 
expected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates only the intrinsic value 
of foreign exchange options in the hedging relationship. The Company designates amounts excluding foreign 
currency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange forward contracts and cross- currency 
interest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts that are designated and effective as 
hedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive income 
(net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss or Balance 
Sheet in the periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge. These are 
treated as cost of hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other 
comprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate 
risk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or 
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss or as an 
adjustment to a non-financial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These 
deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example 
through cost of goods sold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is 
immediately transferred to the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss for the year."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"This section gives an overview of the significance of financial instruments for the Company and provides additional

the best estimate of fair value within that range. These investments in equity instruments are not held for

Although some assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, these may 
not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of 
assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other 
types of assets may change with a lag."

Report on the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of Tata 
Motors Limited (the “Company”) and its joint operation which 
comprise the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, 
and the standalone statement of profit and loss (including 
other comprehensive income), standalone statement of 
changes in equity and standalone statement of cash flows for 
the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial 
statements, including material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and 
give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs 
of the Company as at 31 March 2024, and its profit and other 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows 
for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Standards 
on  Auditing  (SAs)  specified  under  Section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We 
are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code 
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the standalone financial statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Independent Auditor’s Report
Recognition of deferred tax asset on unused tax losses
See Note 28 to standalone financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
As detailed in note 28 of the standalone financial statements, during 
the year, the Company has recognized deferred tax assets (‘DTA’) of 
Rs. 1,248.90 crores on brought forward business losses.
The Company assesses its ability to recover the DTA at the end of 
each reporting period which is based on an assessment of the 
probability that future taxable income will be available against which 
the carried forward unused tas losses can be utilised.
As per the assessment done by the Company, it expects to earn 
sufficient taxable profits based on improved business performance 
and reduction in interest costs in line with the plans for a reduction 
in net debt in subsequent years which enables the Company to utilize 
its carried forward unused tax losses with in permissible time as per 
income tax provisions.
Recognition of DTA involves the assessment of its recoverability 
within the permissible time frame requiring a significant estimate of 
the financial projections, and availability of sufficient future taxable 
income. Considering the history of losses, complexity, and judgment 
involved in the assessment of recovery of deferred tax assets, the 
matter is considered to be a Key Audit Matter.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following audit 
procedures in this area to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence.
Test of Controls:
We tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness 
of management review controls over the key inputs and assumptions 
used to produce future projections of taxable profits.
Test of details:
•	
Evaluated the historical forecasting accuracy of key assumptions 
such as volume, revenue and profit before tax, by comparing 
them to the actual results.
•	
Read minutes of meetings to verify that the budget has been 
approved by the Board of Directors.
•	
Performed sensitivity analysis on key inputs and assumptions, to 
independently estimate a range for comparison and its impact 
on future taxable income.
•	
Checked arithmetical accuracy of calculation of deferred tax.
•	
Involved a taxation specialist to verify the computation of 
Income, related tax, and the impact of open litigations on the 
tax provision.
•	
Performed necessary procedures to verify the accuracy of 
amounts disclosed in the financial statements, and adequacy 
of disclosures made for compliance with applicable Indian 
Accounting Standards and accounting principles generally 
accepted in India.

See Note 37 to standalone financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company operates an exempt pension scheme (‘Scheme’) 
for its employees. Based on the management’s assessment, 
the exempt status of the Scheme calls for an automatic 
cancellation at the end of three consecutive years of losses, 
which the Company has had over financial years 2019-20, 
2020-21 and 2021-22. Further, the Company had applied 
to the Employee Provided Fund Organization (‘EPFO’) to 
surrender the scheme in 2019. However, the said application 
has not been accepted by EPFO till date.
Separately, on November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
in petition by different individuals ruled that those that were 
members of a statutory pension fund as on September 1, 2014, 
can exercise a joint option with their employer to contribute 
funds beyond the statutory limit and opt to draw pension 
out of it basis their last 5 years average salary. Accordingly, 
the Company has determined the list of employees who have 
opted for the above option given by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court and has approved the same on the EPFO’s portal 
along with a communication to the EPFO that the Company 
shall fund the additional liability estimated through actuarial 
valuation.
While the Company believes that their scheme should now be 
handled by the EPFO, since the same has not been accepted, 
the Company has involved an actuarial expert to evaluate 
pension liability per Ind AS-19 – Employee Benefits.
Significant effort has gone into interpreting the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court Order and determining the amount, including 
the completeness of the details considered, that would 
have significant effect on estimating the additional pension 
liability. The risk is that the judgements used for valuation 
are inappropriate and could lead to an error resulting into an 
inappropriate valuation of additional pension liabilities.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the 
following audit procedures in this area to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence.
Test of Controls:
Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of key controls over the assumptions and membership data 
used in valuation of defined benefit obligation (pension).
Test of details:
•	
Evaluated   the   competence,   capability    and objectivity 
of the Company’s external actuarial expert who 
performed the valuation of additional pension liability.
•	
Assessed the assumptions used by management’s 
external actuarial expert in valuing the amount of 
additional pension liability.
•	
Evaluated the management’s assessment with respect to 
interpretation of Supreme Court order for determination 
of pensionable salary.
•	
Tested the underlying base data for employees who 
applied for exercising the joint option, which was used 
for valuation of additional pension liability.
•	
Evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures 
with respect the additional pension liability
Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the annual report, 
but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s 
report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made 
available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ 
Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes 
in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance

2023-24
384"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to consolidated financial statements,"with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified 
under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management 
and Board of Directors of the companies are responsible for 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets 
of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for assessing the ability of each company to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors are responsible for 
overseeing the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of standalone financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Company and such other entity included in the standalone 
financial statements of which we are the independent 
auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements of Tata Motors Limited (“the 
Company”) and such company incorporated in India under 
the Act which is its joint operation company as of 31 March 
2024 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company and such company incorporated 
in India which is its joint operation company have, in all 
material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and such internal financial 
controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, 
based on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements criteria established by such companies 
considering the essential components of such internal 
controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance 
Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The respective company’s Management and the Board of 
Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the respective company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the standalone financial statements of Tata 
Motors Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements section 
of our report of even date)
Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements were 
established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements include those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company 
are being made only in accordance with authorisations of

394"
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,notes to consolidated financial statements,"management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use 
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated dilapidation 
costs, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the straight-line 
method over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the period of lease. If ownership of the leased asset 
is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease 
payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the leased asset."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement 
date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s 
incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is 
re-measured when there is a change in future lease payments."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Lease payments include fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable 
under a residual value guarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to 
exercise that option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term considered reflects that 
the Company shall exercise termination option. The Company also recognises a right-of-use asset which comprises 
of amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated 
dilapidation costs."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Payment made towards short term leases (leases for which non-cancellable term is 12 months or lesser) and low 
value assets (lease of assets worth less than ₹0.03 crores) are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss as rental 
expenses over the tenor of such leases."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based 
on contractual terms and substance of the lease arrangement. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.

exercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement 
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether 
it is reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within 
its control. It is recognised that there is potential for lease term assumptions to change in the future and this will 
continue to be monitored by the Company where relevant. The Company’s leases mature between 2025 and 2034.

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. When the effect of the time value of money ismaterial, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The estimated liability for product warranties is recognised when products are sold or when new warranty programmes 
are initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost 
of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future warranty claims, customer goodwill and 
recall complaints. The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will arise, being typically up to 
six years. The Company also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle 
fault is proven to be a supplier’s fault."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier, 
adjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on Balance Sheet date. Supplier

Profit and Loss except when they relate to items that are recognised outside of profit and loss (whether in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit and loss. Current 
income taxes are determined based on respective taxable income of each taxable entity."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation 
carry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable 
entity. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable income will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax 
credits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there 
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on 
a net basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability 
that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-
forwards can be utilised."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from interests in joint arrangements are not recognised

reverse in the foreseeable future."

Sale of products - commercial vehicles and vehicle parts."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of 
variable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products 
are delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks 
and rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably 
assured and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of 
variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the 
contract. The Company operates predominantly on cash and carry basis."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company offers sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary 
depending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for 
as a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue 
recognised when any associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates the expected 
sales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer stock and 
local market conditions."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The consideration received in respect of transport arrangements for delivering of vehicles to the customers are

period of service or extended warranty."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"When the Company sells products that are bundled with maintenance service or extended period of warranty, 
such services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is in excess of the 
standard offerings to the customer. In such cases, the transaction price allocated towards such maintenance 
service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price and is recognised as a contract 
liability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold 
separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary 
method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company 
estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on 
similar services."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company operates certain customer loyalty programs under which customer is entitled to reward points 
on the spend towards Company’s products. The reward points earned by customers can be redeemed to claim 
discounts on future purchase of certain products or services. Transaction price allocated towards reward points 
granted to customers is recognised as a deferred income liability and transferred to income when customers 
redeem their reward points."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Sales of services include certain performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time. Any amount 
received in advance in respect of such performance obligations that are satisfied  over a period of time is 
recorded as a contract liability and recorded as revenue when service is rendered to customers."

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as 
at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, 
are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or 
loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured 
at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognised less, the cumulative 
amount of income recognised."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the 
consideration given or received)."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset 
or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability 
at the measurement date."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted 
in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities 
held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow 
method and other valuation methods."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,iii)	 Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities:
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset 
expires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to 
another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an 
associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also 
recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is 
recognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity 
is transferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value 
through other comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained 
earnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company 
reviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that are 
written off could still be subject to enforcement activities."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged, 
cancelled or has expired.

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on a financial asset that is at amortised 
cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are forward looking and are 
measured in a way that is unbiased and represents a probability-weighted amount, takes into account the time 
value of money (values are discounted using the applicable effective interest rate) and uses reasonable and 
supportable information."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these forward contracts 
in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also uses interest 
rate swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate liabilities i.e. 
when interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair 
value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are 
expected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates only the intrinsic value 
of foreign exchange options in the hedging relationship. The Company designates amounts excluding foreign 
currency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange forward contracts and cross- currency 
interest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts that are designated and effective as 
hedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive income 
(net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of Profit and Loss or Balance Sheet in the 
periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge. These are 
treated as cost of hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other 
comprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate 
risk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or 
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of 
profit and loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss or as an adjustment to a non-
financial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These deferred amounts are 
ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example through cost of goods 
sold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is 
retained there until the forecast transaction occurs."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is 
immediately transferred to the statement of Profit and Loss for the year.

subject to variable interest rates. Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet 
date would result in decrease/increase in profit before tax of ₹37.83 crores and ₹44.94 crores for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"The model assumes that interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve. Although some 
assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, these may not react correspondingly 
to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate 
with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets may change with a lag."

debt outstanding during the period."

64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments in equity securities.

of securities. The fair value of Company’s investment in quoted equity securities as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 
was ₹856.59 crores and ₹574.37 crores, respectively. A 10% change in equity price as of March 31, 2024 and 2023

the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of 
deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks."
64f47bc2-72fb-4ade-9f86-f6da144ba604,2023,liquidity,"Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of investments classified 
as fair value through profit and loss, trade receivables, loans and derivative financial instruments. The Company 
strives to promptly identify and reduce concerns about collection due to a deterioration in the financial conditions 
and others of its main counterparties by regularly monitoring their situation based on their financial condition.

credit risk was ₹13,378.09 crores and ₹10,346.83 crores as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, being the 
total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, short term deposits with banks, trade receivables, finance

its books of account, shall use only such accounting software which has a feature of recording audit trail of each and 
every transaction, creating an edit log of each change made in the books of account along with the date when such 
changes were made and ensuring that the audit trail cannot be disabled. The interpretation and guidance on what 
level edit log and audit trail needs to be maintained evolved during the year and continues to evolve."

of accounts and relevant transactions. However, the global standard ERP used by the Company has not been enabled 
with the feature of audit trail log at the database layer to log direct transactional changes, due to present design of 
ERP. This is being taken up with the vendor. In the meanwhile, the Company continues to ensure that direct write 
access to the database is granted only via an approved change management process.

promoters shareholding post allotment of Ordinary Shares in 
the Company remains within the limits approved earlier.

companies as per the Securities and Exchange Board of

2.
Justification 
for 
the 
proposed RPTs
The 
Company’s 
Pune 
plant 
assembles powertrains required 
for manufacture of passenger 
vehicles at FIAPL’s Ranjangaon 
plant for which it purchases 
certain 
engines, 
transaxles, 
catalytic converters and other 
parts from TMPVL.
TML 
assembles 
engines, 
transaxles and fitment of other 
peripheral parts to build the 
powertrain which is sold to FIAPL.
FIAPL uses the powertrain to 
manufacture vehicles
TMPVL 
sells 
castings 
and 
aggregates of engines, metal 
bodies, etc to the Company. 
The Company then assembles 
engines, transaxles and fitment 
of other peripheral parts to build 
the powertrain which is sold to 
FIAPL. FIAPL uses the powertrain 
to manufacture vehicles which is 
eventually sold to TMPVL.
TMPVL also purchases vehicle 
spare parts and components 
from FIAPL.
FIAPL has undertaken to reserve 
certain production capacity of 
its 
Ranjangaon 
Manufacturing 
Facility for manufacturing and 
supplying of motor vehicles and 
related spare parts.
TML has a contract manufacturing 
arrangement (CMA) with FIAPL 
for manufacture of engines and 
vehicles. 
The 
manufacturing 
capacity available will be shared 
between TML and FCA based on 
volume commitment given by 
each party. Going forward, the 
Company’s capacity entitlement 
for manufacturing Tata vehicles 
shall be apportioned between 
TMPVL and TPEML on mutually 
agreed basis.
The existing principles of cost 
allocation, take or pay arrangement 
and true up mechanism (including 
for expenses and mechanism 
for adjustments) as defined in 
CMA will apply between TMPVL 
and TPEML on mutually agreed 
basis. Considering there would 
be flexibility to use each other’s 
capacities even as the year 
progresses, this would bring in 
better operational efficiency for 
TPEML as well as TMPVL.
The aforementioned transactions 
would not only help both the 
Companies to manage its business 
operations smoothly but would 
also ensure a consistent flow of 
desired quality and quantity of 
various facilities for uninterrupted 
operations and an increase in 
productivity. This in turn will 
contribute towards Tata Motors’ 
group synergy.
