If \nwe are to meet our net zero ambition, \nwe must change that dynamic primarily \nthrough three mission statements: \nCircular resources: We must act as \na responsible user of resources by \nmaximising reuse, replenishment \nand recycling.

These \nenablers rely on a strong supplier \nbase and key innovative partners \nwith a common vision to create \nsystems where value is distributed \nalong the product lifecycle. The \nenablers include the setting up of \na circularity hub, driving circularity \nimprovements throughout the entire \nsupply chain via our Circular Supply \nChain department and meet-up \nevents to inspire and mobilise our \nsustainability innovation ecosystem \nby driving circular solutions through \nsystemic value chain collaboration.\nTo ensure we act as a responsible user of resources we have set specific \nlong-term goals to drive an increase in the quantity of recycled content in our \nproducts, to reduce waste to landfill and to energy recovery, and reduce our \nconsumption of water per vehicle produced.\nMaterials: At least double and aim to treble recycled content in new products \nfrom 2028 \nWaste: Achieve zero waste to landfill and increase non-metallic waste sent for \nrecycling/reuse to 80% by FY30\nWater: Reduce our water consumption per vehicle produced by a third \nby FY30\nWe intend to increase the share of products and services which contribute \nto our circular economy goals by growing our capability to reuse parts and \nvehicles.

    "text": "Recognition of deferred tax assets, as reported by the component auditor of JLR Group\nSee Note 22 to consolidated financial statements\nThe key audit matter\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\nJLR Group previously had significant unused tax losses for \nwhich no deferred tax asset was recognised. These losses \narose mostly in the UK. Improved UK trading has led to UK \ntaxable profits becoming available which, when taken with \nprobable, forecast UK taxable profits are sufficient to fully \nutilise those past UK taxable losses. A deferred tax asset has \nbeen recognised in the current year in respect of remaining, \npast UK taxable losses.\nThere is inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting future \ntaxable profits, which determines the extent to which \ndeferred tax assets are ,or are not, recognised.\nThere is judgement involved in determining the extent to \nwhich it is probable that future profits will arise to utilise the \nnet deferred tax asset.\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of component \nauditor’s risk assessment, component auditor determined \nthat the recoverable amount of deferred tax assets has a high \ndegree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of \nreasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the \nfinancial statements as a whole, and possibly many times \nthat amount.\nThe component auditor performed the tests below rather \nthan seeking to rely on any of the JLR Group’s controls because \nthe nature of the balance is such that component auditor \nwould expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through \nthe detailed procedures described. Component auditor’s \nprocedures included:\n•\t\nAssessing forecasts: Component auditor’s work over \nthe JLR Group’s forecasts is principally based on the \nwork described in the ‘Impairment of property plant \nand equipment, intangible, and right-of use non-current \nassets’ key audit matter reported above.\n•\t\nComponent auditor’s tax expertise: Component auditor \ninvolved their tax specialists to assist in assessing the \nrecoverability of the tax losses against the forecast \nfuture taxable profits, taking into account the JLR Group’s \ntax position, the timing of forecast taxable profits and \ncomponent auditor’s knowledge and experience of the \napplication of relavant tax legislations.\n•\t\nAssessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of \nthe JLR Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the \nrecognition of deferred tax assets to changes in key \nassumptions reflected in the inherent risk.\nRecognition of deferred tax asset on unused tax losses\nSee Note 22 to consolidated financial statements\nThe key audit matter\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\nAs detailed in note 22 of the consoldiated financial statements, \nduring the year, the Holding Company has recognized deferred \ntax assets (‘DTA’) of Rs. 1,248.90 crores on brought forward \nbusiness losses.\nThe Company assesses its ability to recover the DTA at the \nend of each reporting period which is based on an assessment \nof the probability that future taxable income will be available \nagainst which the carried forward unused tax losses can \nbe utilised.\nAs per the assessment done by the Company, it expects to \nearn sufficient taxable profits based on improved business \nperformance and reduction in interest costs in line with the \nplans for a reduction in net debt in subsequent years which \nenables the Company to utilize its carried forward unused tax \nlosses within permissible time as per income tax provisions.\nRecognition of DTA involves the assessment of its recoverability \nwithin the permissible time frame requiring a significant \nestimate of the financial projections, and availability of \nsufficient future taxable income. Considering the history of \nlosses, complexity, and judgment involved in the assessment \nof recovery of deferred tax assets, the matter is considered to \nbe a key audit matter.\nIn view of the significance of the matter, we applied the \nfollowing audit procedures in this area to obtain sufficient \nappropriate audit evidence.\nTest of Controls:\nWe tested the design, implementation, and operating \neffectiveness of management review controls over the key \ninputs and assumptions used to produce future projections \nof taxable profits.\nTest of details:\n•\t\nEvaluated the historical forecasting accuracy of key \nassumptions such as volume, revenue and profit before \ntax, by comparing them to the actual results.\n•\t\nRead minutes of meetings to verify that the budget has \nbeen approved by the Board of Directors.\n•\t\nPerformed sensitivity analysis on key inputs and \nassumptions, to independently estimate a range for \ncomparison and its impact on future taxable income.\n•\t\nChecked arithmetical accuracy of calculation of \ndeferred tax.\n79th Integrated Annual Report\n2023-24\n264",

Based on the management’s assessment, \nthe exempt status of the Scheme calls for an automatic \ncancellation at the end of three consecutive years of losses, \nwhich the Company has had over financial years 2019-20, \n2020-21 and 2021-22. Further the Company had applied to the \nEmployee Provident Fund Organization (‘EPFO’) to surrender \nthe scheme in 2019. However, the said application has not \nbeen accepted by EPFO till date.\nSeparately, on November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme \nCourt in petition by different individuals ruled that those that \nwere members of a statutory pension fund as on September \n1, 2014, can exercise a joint option with their employer to \ncontribute to their fund beyond the statutory limit and opt \nto draw pension out of it basis their last 5 years average \nsalary. Accordingly, the Company has determined the list of \nemployees who have opted for the above option given by \nthe Hon’ble Supreme Court and has approved the same on \nthe EPFO’s portal along with a communication to the EPFO \nthat the Company shall fund the additional liability estimated \nthrough actuarial valuation.\nWhile the Company believes that their scheme should now be \nhandled by the EPFO, since the same has not been accepted, \nthe Company has involved an actuarial expert to evaluate \npension liability per Ind AS-19 – Employee Benefits.\nSignificant effort has gone into interpreting the Hon’ble \nSupreme Court Order and determining the amount, including \nthe completeness of the details considered, that would \nhave significant effect on estimating the additional pension \nliability. The risk is that the judgements used for valuation \nare inappropriate and could lead to an error resulting into an \ninappropriate valuation of additional pension liabilities.\nIn view of the significance of the matter we applied the \nfollowing audit procedures in this area to obtain sufficient \nappropriate audit evidence.\nTest of Controls:\nTested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \nof key controls over the assumptions and membership data \nused in valuation of defined benefit obligation (pension).\nTest of details:\n•\t\nEvaluated the competence, capability and objectivity of \nthe Company’ external actuarial expert who performed \nthe valuation of additional pension liability.\n•\t\nAssessed the assumptions used by management’s \nexternal actuarial expert in valuing the amount of \nadditional pension liability.\n•\t\nEvaluated the management’s assessment with respect to \ninterpretation of Supreme Court order for determination \nof pensionable salary.\n•\t\nTested the underlying base data for employees who \napplied for exercising the joint option, which was used \nfor valuation of additional pension liability.\n•\t\nEvaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures \nwith respect to additional pension liability.\n265\nSTANDALONE \nFINANCIALS\n383\nINTEGRATED  \nREPORT\n4\nSTATUTORY \nREPORTS\n132\nCONSOLIDATED \nFINANCIALS\n262",

    "text": "Capitalisation of product engineering assets, as reported by the component auditor of JLR Group\nSee Note 6 to consolidated financial statements\nThe key audit matter\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\nJLR Group has historically capitalised a high proportion of \nproduct development cost and there is a key judgement in \ndetermining whether the nature of the product engineering \ncosts satisfy the criteria for capitalisation to ‘Intangible \nAssets, Product Development In Progress’, when this \ncapitalisation should commence, and whether capitalisation \nshould continue.\nThe judgement of whether capitalisation should continue \nrequires the satisfaction of a number of Ind AS 38 \ncapitalisation criteria and a key judgement in assessing \nwhether development projects will generate probable future \neconomic benefit. There are a number of projects which met \nthe capitalisation gateway prior to this financial year and \nwhich have incurred material levels of development spend \nin the current financial year. These projects include those \nrelated to the Group’s transition to Battery Electric Vehicles \n(BEV) resulting from its previously announced “Reimagine” \nstrategy. This has elevated the risk in relation to the on- \ngoing capitalisation of costs. Few projects have commenced \ncapitalisation for the first time in the current year. This has \nreduced the risk in relation to the current year timing of \ncapitalisation judgement such that it does not form part of \nour key audit matter in the current year.\nIt is also noted that there is a risk of fraud around the allocation \nof directly attributable expenditure to the correct project \ncodes to ensure appropriate costs are being capitalised.\nThe consolidated financial statements (note-6) disclose \nan amount of Rs. 1,564.89 crores to represent what the \nreduction in the amount capitalised would be if the value of \ncentral overheads had not been identified by the Directors as \nbeing eligible for capitalisation.\nThe audit procedure applied by the auditor of the component \n(JLR Group) included:\n•\t\nControl operation: Tested controls including in relation\nto the Directors’ assessment as to whether product\nengineering costs are eligible for capitalisation.\n•\t\nPersonnel interviews: Corroborated judgements made\nby the Directors around the continuation of capitalisation\nof product engineering costs through discussions with\nproject level staff.\n•\t\nComponent auditor’s sector experience: Critically\nassessed the Directors’ judgements regarding product\nengineering costs identified by the Directors as being\neligible for capitalisation against both the accounting\nstandards and their experience of practical application\nof these standards in other companies.\n•\t\nConsider \naltenatives: \nCritically \nassessed \ninternal\nconsistency between assumptions used in the JLR Group’s\nassessment of economic viability on key development\nprojects and assumptions used in cash flow forecasts in\ncalculation of JLR Group’s value in use assessed through\ncomponent auditor’s response to the significant risk of\nImpairment of property plant and equipment, intangible,\nand right-of use noncurrent assets\n•\t\nTests of details: For a sample of product engineering\ncosts identified by the Directors as being eligible for\ncapitalisation, agreed that their nature was consistent\nwith the description of the account to which those\ncosts were recorded, and the timing of recognition\nwas appropriate. In addition, component auditor\ninspected any reallocations from accounts ineligible for\ncapitalisation to accounts that are eligible as capitalised\nproject engineering costs, which component auditor\nwould consider to meet the criteria of a high risk journal,\nand obtained evidence to confirm appropriateness.\n•\t\nAssessing \ntransparency: \nAssessed \nthe \nadequacy\nof the JLR Group’s disclosures in respect of the key\njudgements made.\nValuation of defined benefit plan obligations, as reported by the component auditor of JLR Group\nSee Note 36 to consolidated financial statements\nThe key audit matter\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\nSubjective valuation\nSmall changes in the key assumptions applied to valuation \nof the liabilities, being the discount rate, inflation rate and \nmortality/life expectancy used to value the JLR Group’s \npension obligation (before deducting scheme assets) would \nhave a significant effect on the amount of the JLR Group’s \nnet pension surplus. The risk is that these assumptions are \ninappropriate resulting in an inappropriate valuation of \nplan liabilities.\nThe audit procedure applied by the auditor of the component \n(JLR Group) included:\n•\t\nControl Operation: Tested controls operating over the\nassumptions applied in the valuation and inspected the\nJLR Group’s annual validation of the assumptions used\nby its actuarial expert. Tested the JLR Group’s control\noperating over selection and monitoring of its acturial\nexpert for competence and objectivity.\n79th Integrated Annual Report\n2023-24\n266",

The estimation of Expected Credit Loss \n(ECL) on financial instruments involves significant judgements \nand estimates. The key areas where component auditor \nidentified greater levels of management judgement and \ntherefore increased levels of audit focus in the estimation of \nECLs are:\n•\t\nData inputs - The application of ECL model requires \nseveral data inputs. This increases the risk of \ncompleteness and accuracy of the data that has been \nused to create assumptions in the model.\n•\t\nModel estimations - Inherently judgmental models \nare used to estimate ECL which involves determining \nProbabilities of Default (“PD”), Loss Given Default \n(“’LGD’’), and Exposures at Default (“EAD”). The PD and \nthe LGD are the key drivers of estimation complexity in \nECL and as a result are considered the most significant \njudgmental aspect of the Company’s modelling approach.\n•\t\nQualitative adjustments - Adjustments to the model-\ndriven ECL results are recorded by component \nmanagement to address known impairment model \nlimitations or emerging trends as well as risks not \ncaptured by models. These adjustments are inherently \nuncertain and significant management judgement is \ninvolved in estimating these amounts.\nThe audit procedures applied by the auditor of the \ncomponent(TMFL) included:\nDesign/Controls\nThe component auditor performed end to end process \nwalkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and \ncontrol used in ECL processes. Tested the relevant manual \n(including spresheet controls), general IT and application \ncontrols over the key system used in ECL process.\nKey aspects of controls testing involved following:\n•\t\nTesting the design and operating effectiveness of the \nkey controls over the completeness and accuracy of the \nkey inputs, data and assumptions into the Ind AS 109 \nimpairment models\n•\t\nTesting the ‘Governance Framework’ controls over \nvalidation, implementation and model monitoring inline \nwith Reserve Bank of India guidance.\n•\t\nTesting the design and operating effectiveness of the key \ncontrols over the application of the staging criteria.\n•\t\nTesting \nkey \ncontrols \nrelating \nto \nselection \nand \nimplementation of material macro-economic variables \nand the controls over the scenario selection and \napplication of probability weights.\n•\t\nTesting management’s controls over authorisation \nand calculation of post model adjustments and \nmanagement overlays.\n267\nSTANDALONE \nFINANCIALS\n383\nINTEGRATED  \nREPORT\n4\nSTATUTORY \nREPORTS\n132\nCONSOLIDATED \nFINANCIALS\n262",

The discount rate is regarded as a key assumption \nas it is the rate which drives the discounted cashflows used to determine the VIU of the CGU primarily due to the level of \njudgement and estimation involved and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to small changes in the percentage.\n79th Integrated Annual Report\n2023-24\n300",

In making this assessment in previous periods it was considered that JLR \nhad consistently generated taxable losses in recent years, was continuing to generate taxable losses in the then \ncurrent period and was forecast to generate some taxable income in future periods that may not have been \nsufficient to utilise the related tax assets. During the year ended March 31, 2024 there has been a significant \nimprovement in performance. Sufficient taxable profits are forecast to be generated within the 5-year detailed \nbusiness plan to utilise all of the net deferred tax asset prior to consideration of restrictions on the amount of \nUK tax losses and UK tax depreciation that can be offset against UK taxable profits each year. As a result of these \nUK tax rules the recoverability of all of the net UK deferred tax asset will continue beyond our 5-year detailed \nbusiness plan. The forecasts are based on the Company’s impairment model. The sensitivity analysis applied \nto the impairment model as described in does not impact the ability to recover the UK deferred tax asset in \nfull. When the tax assets are utilised in future years it is expected that the impact will be recorded within the \nunderlying tax charge for that year to match with the similar classification of the corresponding taxable profits \nof that year.",

Our responsibilities under those SAs are further \ndescribed in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \nStandalone Financial Statements section of our report. We \nare independent of the Company in accordance with the Code \nof Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \nIndia together with the ethical requirements that are relevant \nto our audit of the standalone financial statements under \nthe provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we \nhave fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance \nwith these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe \nthat the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient \nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the \nstandalone financial statements.\nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \njudgment, were of most significance in our audit of the \nstandalone financial statements of the current period. These \nmatters were addressed in the context of our audit of the \nstandalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming \nour opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate \nopinion on these matters.\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\nRecognition of deferred tax asset on unused tax losses\nSee Note 28 to standalone financial statements\nThe key audit matter\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\nAs detailed in note 28 of the standalone financial statements, during \nthe year, the Company has recognized deferred tax assets (‘DTA’) of \nRs. 1,248.90 crores on brought forward business losses.\nThe Company assesses its ability to recover the DTA at the end of \neach reporting period which is based on an assessment of the \nprobability that future taxable income will be available against which \nthe carried forward unused tas losses can be utilised.\nAs per the assessment done by the Company, it expects to earn \nsufficient taxable profits based on improved business performance \nand reduction in interest costs in line with the plans for a reduction \nin net debt in subsequent years which enables the Company to utilize \nits carried forward unused tax losses with in permissible time as per \nincome tax provisions.\nRecognition of DTA involves the assessment of its recoverability \nwithin the permissible time frame requiring a significant estimate of \nthe financial projections, and availability of sufficient future taxable \nincome. Considering the history of losses, complexity, and judgment \ninvolved in the assessment of recovery of deferred tax assets, the \nmatter is considered to be a Key Audit Matter.\nIn view of the significance of the matter we applied the following audit \nprocedures in this area to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence.\nTest of Controls:\nWe tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness \nof management review controls over the key inputs and assumptions \nused to produce future projections of taxable profits.\nTest of details:\n•\t\n\u0007Evaluated the historical forecasting accuracy of key assumptions \nsuch as volume, revenue and profit before tax, by comparing \nthem to the actual results.\n•\t\n\u0007Read minutes of meetings to verify that the budget has been \napproved by the Board of Directors.\n•\t\n\u0007Performed sensitivity analysis on key inputs and assumptions, to \nindependently estimate a range for comparison and its impact \non future taxable income.\n•\t\n\u0007Checked arithmetical accuracy of calculation of deferred tax.\n•\t\n\u0007Involved a taxation specialist to verify the computation of \nIncome, related tax, and the impact of open litigations on the \ntax provision.\n•\t\n\u0007Performed necessary procedures to verify the accuracy of \namounts disclosed in the financial statements, and adequacy \nof disclosures made for compliance with applicable Indian \nAccounting Standards and accounting principles generally \naccepted in India.\n383\nSTANDALONE \nFINANCIALS\n383\nINTEGRATED  \nREPORT\n4\nSTATUTORY \nREPORTS\n132\nCONSOLIDATED \nFINANCIALS\n262",

    "text": "Valuation of defined benefit obligation (pension)\nSee Note 37 to standalone financial statements\nThe key audit matter\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\nThe Company operates an exempt pension scheme (‘Scheme’) \nfor its employees. Based on the management’s assessment, \nthe exempt status of the Scheme calls for an automatic \ncancellation at the end of three consecutive years of losses, \nwhich the Company has had over financial years 2019-20, \n2020-21 and 2021-22. Further, the Company had applied \nto the Employee Provided Fund Organization (‘EPFO’) to \nsurrender the scheme in 2019. However, the said application \nhas not been accepted by EPFO till date.\nSeparately, on November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme Court \nin petition by different individuals ruled that those that were \nmembers of a statutory pension fund as on September 1, 2014, \ncan exercise a joint option with their employer to contribute \nfunds beyond the statutory limit and opt to draw pension \nout of it basis their last 5 years average salary. Accordingly, \nthe Company has determined the list of employees who have \nopted for the above option given by the Hon’ble Supreme \nCourt and has approved the same on the EPFO’s portal \nalong with a communication to the EPFO that the Company \nshall fund the additional liability estimated through actuarial \nvaluation.\nWhile the Company believes that their scheme should now be \nhandled by the EPFO, since the same has not been accepted, \nthe Company has involved an actuarial expert to evaluate \npension liability per Ind AS-19 – Employee Benefits.\nSignificant effort has gone into interpreting the Hon’ble \nSupreme Court Order and determining the amount, including \nthe completeness of the details considered, that would \nhave significant effect on estimating the additional pension \nliability. The risk is that the judgements used for valuation \nare inappropriate and could lead to an error resulting into an \ninappropriate valuation of additional pension liabilities.\nIn view of the significance of the matter we applied the \nfollowing audit procedures in this area to obtain sufficient \nappropriate audit evidence.\nTest of Controls:\nTested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \nof key controls over the assumptions and membership data \nused in valuation of defined benefit obligation (pension).\nTest of details:\n•\t\nEvaluated   the   competence,   capability    and objectivity \nof the Company’s external actuarial expert who \nperformed the valuation of additional pension liability.\n•\t\nAssessed the assumptions used by management’s \nexternal actuarial expert in valuing the amount of \nadditional pension liability.\n•\t\nEvaluated the management’s assessment with respect to \ninterpretation of Supreme Court order for determination \nof pensionable salary.\n•\t\nTested the underlying base data for employees who \napplied for exercising the joint option, which was used \nfor valuation of additional pension liability.\n•\t\nEvaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures \nwith respect the additional pension liability\nOther Information\nThe Company’s Management and Board of Directors are \nresponsible for the other information. The other information \ncomprises the information included in the annual report, \nbut does not include the financial statements and auditor’s \nreport thereon. The annual report is expected to be made \navailable to us after the date of this auditor’s report.\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does not \ncover the other information and we will not express any form \nof assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial \nstatements, our responsibility is to read the other information \nidentified above when it becomes available and, in doing \nso, consider whether the other information is materially \ninconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our \nknowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be \nmaterially misstated.\nWhen we read the annual report, if we conclude that there \nis a material misstatement therein, we are required to \ncommunicate the matter to those charged with governance \nand take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant \nlaws and regulations.\nManagement’s and Board of Directors’ \nResponsibilities for the Standalone Financial \nStatements\nThe Company’s Management and Board of Directors are \nresponsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act \nwith respect to the preparation of these standalone financial \nstatements that give a true and fair view of the state of \naffairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes \nin equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance \n79th Integrated Annual Report\n2023-24\n384",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, \nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \nwith SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it \nexists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they \ncould reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone \nfinancial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \nthroughout the audit. We also:\n•\t\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement \nof the standalone financial statements, whether due \nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or \nthe override of internal control.\n•\t\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to \nthe audit in order to design audit procedures that are \nappropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)\n(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our \nopinion on whether the company has adequate internal \nfinancial controls with reference to financial statements \nin place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n•\t\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies \nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \nand related disclosures made by the Management and \nBoard of Directors.\n•\t\nConclude on the appropriateness of the Management \nand Board of Directors use of the going concern basis \nof accounting in preparation of standalone financial \nstatements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, \nwhether a material uncertainty exists related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the \nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern. If \nwe conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we \nare required to draw attention in our auditor’s report \nto the related disclosures in the standalone financial \nstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the \naudit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s \nreport.
